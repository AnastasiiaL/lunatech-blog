:tags: [playframework,scala]

If you want to have any kind of login on your Play 2  app, and don’t want to spend the time coding one yourself, the http://securesocial.ws[SecureSocial] module is the way to go. This article will show you how to combine it with http://slick.typesafe.com/[Slick], a Scala persistence API, to store your user’s authentication details. 

== SecureSocial

SecureSocial is a Play 2 module that makes it very easy to add
authentication to your Play app. It supports several authentication
methods and allows you to add your own. Out of the box, it supports
logging using bunch of social networks, as well as a more conventional
password-based sign-up and login method.

SecureSocial is not usable out-of-the-box. You need to implement some
classes in order integrate it into your application. Specifically, you
need to provide a model class that implements the `Identity` trait to
represent user information, and tell SecureSocial how to store and find
instances of that model by providing it with an implementation of the
`UserService` trait.

== `Identity`

Let’s start with the model class. SecureSocial uses `securesocial.core.Identity` objects to represent login details. `Identity` objects store all data that identifies a user:

* A combination of identity provider and the user’s ID for that provider
* First name
* Last name
* Full name
* Email address
* The authentication method (OAuth 1, OAuth2, OpenId or user name and password)
* One of:
  * OAuth 1 information (identifier, secret)
  * OAuth 2 information (accessToken, tokenType, ttl, refreshToken)
  * Password information (password hasher, password, salt) 

If you are the kind of person that prefers code, take a look at the
actual
https://github.com/jaliss/securesocial/blob/master/module-code/app/securesocial/core/SocialUser.scala[source
code].

This trait is easy to implement if we use a case class:

[source,scala,linenums]
----
case class User(uid: Option[Long] = None,
                id: UserId,
                firstName: String,
                lastName: String,
                fullName: String,
                email: Option[String],
                avatarUrl: Option[String],
                authMethod: AuthenticationMethod,
                oAuth1Info: Option[OAuth1Info],
                oAuth2Info: Option[OAuth2Info],
                passwordInfo: Option[PasswordInfo] = None) extends Identity
----

Now that we have our model class, we’re going to have to find a way to
store instances of it. This is managed by an implementation of the
`UserService` trait. The
https://github.com/jaliss/securesocial/tree/master/samples/scala/demo[sample
application] has an
https://github.com/jaliss/securesocial/blob/master/samples/scala/demo/app/service/InMemoryUserService.scala[implementation]
that stores these in memory, but for a real-world application you want
to store this information somewhere else, like in a database. So, it’s
time to use Slick to map our class to a database table.

== Mapping our `User` case class

With Slick, mapping database tables to case classes is usually easy –
all you need to do if define a `*` _projection_ method using the case
class’ `apply` and `unapply` methods. That usually looks something like
this:

[source,scala,linenums]
----
-case class Address(id: Option[Long], street: String,
  postalCode: String, city: String, country: String)

object Organisations extends Table[Address]("address") {
  // table definitions would go here

  def * = id ~ street ~ postalCode ~ city ~ 
    country <> (Address.apply _)(Organisation.unapply _)

----

What that actually does is provide Slick with a function needed to go
from a tuple of table type to the model class. That happens to be
exactly what a case class’ `apply` and `unapply` methods do.

Unfortunately, our `User` case class is a little more complex: five of
the properties are of types that can’t be mapped to a table directly:
`UserId`, `AuthenticationMethod`, `OAuth1Info`, `OAuth2Info` and
`PasswordInfo`. That means that we can’t just use the `apply` and
`unapply` methods. We’ll have to do a little more work.

First, let’s just `flatten' our datamodel, and map the properties for
those classes as if they were part of our `User` class. The code is in
the listing, below.

[source,scala,linenums]
----
object Users extends Table[User]("user") {

  def uid = column[Long]("id", O.PrimaryKey, O.AutoInc)
  def userId = column[String]("userId")
  def providerId = column[String]("providerId")

  def email = column[Option[String]]("email")
  def firstName = column[String]("firstName")
  def lastName = column[String]("lastName")
  def fullName = column[String]("fullName")
  def avatarUrl = column[Option[String]]("avatarUrl")

  def authMethod = column[AuthenticationMethod]("authMethod")

  // oAuth 1
  def token = column[Option[String]]("token")
  def secret = column[Option[String]]("secret")

  // oAuth 2
  def accessToken = column[Option[String]]("accessToken")
  def tokenType = column[Option[String]]("tokenType")
  def expiresIn = column[Option[Int]]("expiresIn")
  def refreshToken = column[Option[String]]("refreshToken")

  // passwordInfo 
  def hasher = column[String]("hasher")
  def password = column[String]("password")
  def salt = column[String]("salt")
}
----

In order to create the projection, we need to write functions that go
from this list of columns to a instance of `User`, and the other way
around. To do that, we actually have five things we have to convert
first:

* `userId` and `providerId` must become a `UserId` instance
* `authMethod` must become an `AuthenticationMethod` instance
* `token`, `secret`, must be combined into an `Option[OAuth1Info]`
* `accessToken`, `tokenType`, `expiresIn` and `refreshToken` must be
combined into an `Option[OAuth2Info]`
* `hasher`, `password`, and `salt` must be combined into an
`Option[PasswordInfo]`

While we could do that in the function definition itself, it’s cleaner
to just create methods for it. In fact, we could make the methods
implicit conversions, and we would’t even have to call them ourselves.
Here are the methods:

[source,scala,linenums]
----
implicit def tuple2UserId(tuple: (String, String)) = tuple match {
  case (userId, providerId) => UserId(userId, providerId)
}

implicit def string2AuthenticationMethod: TypeMapper[AuthenticationMethod] =
  MappedTypeMapper.base[AuthenticationMethod, String](
    authenticationMethod => authenticationMethod.method,
    string => AuthenticationMethod(string)
  )

implicit def tuple2OAuth1Info(tuple: (Option[String], Option[String])) = 
  tuple match {
    case (Some(token), Some(secret)) => Some(OAuth1Info(token, secret))
    case _ => None
  }

implicit def tuple2OAuth2Info(tuple: (Option[String], Option[String],
  Option[Int], Option[String])) = tuple match {
    case (Some(token), tokenType, expiresIn, refreshToken) => 
      Some(OAuth2Info(token, tokenType, expiresIn, refreshToken))
    case _ => None
}

implicit def tuple2PasswordInfo(tuple: (String, String, Option[String])) =
  tuple match {
    case (Some(hasher), Some(password), salt) => 
      Some(PasswordInfo(hasher, password, salt))
    case _ => None
  }

----


Now, we can write our projection. Given the number of fields, it’s not
exactly the prettiest code, but it does its job. Here’s the code:

[source,scala,linenums]
----
def * = uid.? ~ userId ~ providerId ~ firstName ~ lastName ~ fullName ~
 email ~ avatarUrl ~ authMethod ~ token ~ secret ~ accessToken ~ tokenType ~
 expiresIn ~ refreshToken <>(
    u => User(u._1, 
      (u._2, u._3),
      u._4, 
      u._5,
      u._6,
      u._7,
      u._8,
      u._9,
      (u._10, u._11),
      (u._12, u._13, u._14, u._15),
      (u._16, u._17, u._18)),
    (u: User) => Some((u.uid, u.id.id,
       u.id.providerId,
       u.firstName,
       u.lastName,
       u.fullName,
       u.email,
       u.authMethod,
       u.avatarUrl,
       u.oAuth1Info.map(_.token),
       u.oAuth1Info.map(_.secret),
       u.oAuth2Info.map(_.accessToken),
       u.oAuth2Info.flatMap(_.tokenType),
       u.oAuth2Info.flatMap(_.expiresIn),
       u.oAuth2Info.flatMap(_.refreshToken),
       u.passwordInfo.map(_.hasher),
       u.passwordInfo.map(_.password),
       u.passwordInfo.flatMap(_.salt))))
----

As you can see, by putting the right fields in parentheses, we create
tuples of the right form, which the implict methods then convert in the
proper object for us. The reverse function is a little simpler, and
mainly involves a lot of mapping and flatmapping from `Option` types.

== Implementing `UserService`

Now that we mapped this class, we can add `save` and `find` methods to
the `User` class: 

[source,scala,linenums]
----
def findByUserId(userId: UserId): Option[User] = DB.withSession {
implicit session =>
  val query = for {
    user <- Users
    if (user.userId is userId.id) && (user.providerId is userId.providerId)
  } yield user

  query.firstOption
}

def save(i: Identity): User = this.save(User(i))

def save(user: User) = DB.withSession {
implicit session =>
  findByUserId(user.id) match {
    case None => { // Insert a new user (sign-up)
      val uid = this.autoInc.insert(user)
      user.copy(uid = Some(uid))
    }
    case Some(existingUser) => { // Update an existing user
      val userRow = for {
        u <- Users
        if u.uid is existingUser.uid
      } yield u

      val updatedUser = user.copy(uid = existingUser.uid)
      userRow.update(updatedUser)
      updatedUser
    }
  }
}
----


Now all that’s left to do is implement our `UserService`, which has
become very simple now:

[source,scala,linenums]
----
class UserService(application: Application) 
  extends UserServicePlugin(application) {

  def find(id: UserId) = Users.findByUserId(id)
  def save(user: Identity) = Users.save(user)

  // Ok, I'm cheating a little. I'm not explainig how to persist Token
  // But I'm sure you can figure out this part!
  def findByEmailAndProvider(email: String, providerId: String) = None
  def save(token: Token) = ???

  def findToken(token: String) = ???

  def deleteToken(uuid: String) = ???

  def deleteExpiredTokens() = ???
}
----


== Conclusion

Mapping SecureSocial’s `Identity` class to the database is not really
straightforward, especially when using Slick. The main difficulty is
that it uses some other case classes, which require some special
consideration when mapping. This article shows one way to approach this,
and the good news is that you can reuse this on any Play 2 project that
uses Slick and SecureSocial.

If you want to see this code with all the context of an actual
application, I pushed the results of my experiments to
https://github.com/lunatech-labs/lunatech-securesocial-poc[GitHub]. If
you’d like to improve on it (such as implement password-based login,
which I didn’t need), pull requests are welcome.
