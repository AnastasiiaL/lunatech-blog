Lunatech
will be present at this year's http://www.parisjug.org/xwiki/bin/view/Meeting/20100209[second anniversary] of
the http://www.parisjug.org[Paris JUG].

The second anniversary of the biggest French JUGs (but only second
coolest to the http://www.rivierajug.org[Riviera JUG]) will this year
present many open-source technologies made by or with French people.
Since Lunatech Labs is active in open-source Java software, and Lunatech
employees just tend to get involved in and out of work with third-party
open-source software, we got not one but two quickies at the
http://www.parisjug.org/xwiki/bin/view/Meeting/20100209[February 9
event]:
