I told Hugo that the three biggest benefits of Scrum are that it gives
your software development:

. transparency that exposes status, progress and issues that prevent
progress
. the opportunity to address the issues that Scrum helps you identify
. the chance that you will actually improve your software development
process, and therefore project success.

This was not an especially prepared answer, and is one that reflects my
usual operational perspective. If I had been thinking from a
business-focused perspective, I could have just as easily named the
three biggest benefits of:

. customer involvement in key project decisions
. customer control and influence over project direction
. customer responsibility for setting business priorities.
