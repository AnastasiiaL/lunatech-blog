== Where to start if you want to learn shapeless

Recently I decided to have a better look at https://github.com/milessabin/shapeless[shapeless], the generic programming library for scala. In the previous couple of years I had bookmarked several links and have recently read all of them. In this blog post I present the most useful ones for someone who want to be introduced to the library.

The following blog posts are introductory to shapeless. Basically they are a smooth introduction to shapeless, something to warm up

* https://jto.github.io/articles/getting-started-with-shapeless/[Getting started with Shapeless] by https://twitter.com/skaalf[Julien Tournay] (heterogenous lists, polymorphic function values, generic, tuples, lenses)
* https://enear.github.io/2016/04/05/bits-shapeless-1-hlists/[Bits of Shapeless part 1]: HLists by https://twitter.com/ragb[Rui Batista] (Heterogenous lists)

Also these slides on http://slick.lightbend.com/talks/scalaio2014/Type-Level_Computations.pdf[Type-Level Computations] in Scala by https://twitter.com/StefanZeiger[Stefan Zeiger] (not shapeless per se , but a lot of examples for type-level scala, like type-level booleans, type-level natural numbers, translation to types, recursion with types, type functions, type lambdas, heterogenous lists, hlist fold). I tried to find the video talk, but couldn’t find it online.

The https://rnduja.github.io/2016/01/19/a_shapeless_primer/[Α shapeless primer] blog post by https://twitter.com/evacchi[Edoardo Vacchi] is the best and most complete introductory blog post I could find. It really goes into a lot of explaining hlists, product types, Generic[T], FnToProduct[F] object, implicit value resolution, evidences and typeclasses, the Aux Pattern). There is also a https://rnduja.github.io/2015/10/07/scala-dependent-types/[video] presentation by the author Edoardo Vacchi (with https://speakerdeck.com/evacchi/be-like-water-scala-italy-2016[slides]). In this blog post I find very interesting the comparison of Scala with Prolog and how implicit variables, implicit functions, type parameters in functions and implicit parameter lists of functions can be “interpreted” in a rule-based context.

----
Scala                               Prolog
implicit vals	                    facts
implicit defs	                    rules
type parameters in def	            variables in a rule
implicit parameter lists	    bodies of a rule

In https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKaCCYZYBWo[Shapeless? - Easy!], https://twitter.com/valentinkasas[Valentin Kasas] explains in a great way an advanced example of a real life use case (computing deltas) (with https://gist.github.com/vil1/29f2d155679c703edfbe402f067962f6[slides]). From this presentation I took the following http://harrylaou.com/scala/shapeless/deltas/[notes]. There are also available two nice blog posts by Valentin : Shapeless : not a tutorial - http://kanaka.io/blog/2015/11/09/shapeless-not-a-tutorial-part-1.html[part 1] (Heterogenous lists, polymorphic function values, high order poly functions) and part 2 (Generic, singleton types, records and LabelledGeneric)

https://milessabin.com/blog/2012/05/10/shapeless-polymorphic-function-values-2/[In First-class polymorphic function values in shapeless (2 of 3)] — Natural Transformations in Scala, https://twitter.com/milessabin[Miles Sabin] the creator of https://github.com/milessabin/shapeless[shapeless] explains the concepts of polymorphic functions and natural transformations.

In the https://github.com/milessabin/shapeless/wiki/Feature-overview:-shapeless-2.0.0[Shapeless] for Mortals talk, Sam Halliday explains shapeless fundamentals like : type classes (not shapeless per se , but used extensively when using the library), singleton types, HList, LabelledGeneric, Coproduct, Hipster.Aux (SI-823), Higher Order Unification, Implicit Resolution: Recursion , Cycles and Priority, Tags (Notes from the talk)

The page https://github.com/milessabin/shapeless/wiki/Feature-overview:-shapeless-2.0.0[Shapeless features] provides a short overview of the main features of the library : polymorphic function values, heterogenous lists, HList-style operations on standard Scala tuples, facilities for abstracting over arity, heterogenous maps, singleton-typed literals, singleton-typed symbols, extensible records, coproducts and discriminated unions, generic representation of (sealed families of) case classes, boilerplate-free lenses for arbitrary case classes, automatic type class instance derivation, first class lazy values tie implicit recursive knots, collections with statically known sizes, type safe cast(Typeable/TypeCase), testing for non-compilation (illTyped)

After reading https://github.com/milessabin/shapeless/wiki/Feature-overview:-shapeless-2.0.0[Shapeless features] , the natural thing to follow is the https://www.scala-exercises.org/shapeless/polymorphic_function_values[Scala exercises] in shapeless by https://twitter.com/47deg[47 deg], which is almost identical to Shapeless features, but you will need to fill in the gaps so as to solve the exercises.

A lot of examples are available in https://github.com/milessabin/shapeless/tree/master/examples/src/main/scala/shapeless/examples[Shapeless examples]

bonus : Although not shapeless specific, there are two very interesting talks about Lenses

* https://github.com/milessabin/shapeless/tree/master/examples/src/main/scala/shapeless/examples[Lenses: Fields as Values] (examples https://github.com/SethTisue/lens-examples/tree/master/src/main/scala[slides]) where https://twitter.com/sethtisue[Seth Tissue] explains the concept of Lenses and uses shapeless lenses.
* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nyGVgGEKdA[Beyond Scala Lenses] where https://twitter.com/julientruffaut[Julien Truffaut] (the creator of the https://github.com/julien-truffaut/Monocle[Monocle] library which is built with shapeless ) explains the optics terms  Iso, Prism, Lens and Optional.
