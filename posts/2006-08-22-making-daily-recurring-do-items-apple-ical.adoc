:title: Making daily recurring To Do items in Apple iCal
:tags: [applescript,ical]

I just worked out how to use http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/applescript/[AppleScript] to create recurring daily to do items in http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/ical/[Apple iCal].

I would love to say that it is otherwise, but the fact is, I am terrible at keeping to a rhythm. No matter how firmly I seem to have a simple daily rhythm in grasp I always fall back into my old habits within a few weeks.</p>

<p>To combat this I need a daily checklist. However, this feature is not available in iCal. Disappointed, I looked elsewhere and disliking everything I found, I scrapped my productivity boosting plan entirely and went back to occasionally forgetting my daily list in Omni Outliner.</p>

<p>Yesterday a conversation with a friend pushed me to try this with <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/automator/">Automator</a>, which, unfortunately is not suited to the task. Luckily, I recall a long while ago hearing something about an age-old scripting language named "AppleScript".</p>

<p>After taking a half hour to get myself into The Way I finally managed to rustle up a small script that inserted a To Do item into iCal. To my delight it was trivial in iCal to add a recurring 6 am even, which as its alarm, would Run the Script.</p>

<p>Each morning a new daily To Do list item "Fill-in time sheet" is created. This works just as any To Do list item - if I have not completed it by the end of the evening, it will carry on to the following day. I suggest setting 'Hide To Do items <em>_</em> days after they are complete' to one or two days.</p>

<p>So, without further ado, here's the script:</p>

<pre style="padding-left: 2em">
-- doesn&apos;t create duplicates. adds todo&apos;s to calendar &quot;Personal&quot;
on createTodo(summaryText)
	set now to current date
	set midnight to now - (time of now)
	tell application &quot;iCal&quot;
		-- don&apos;t create an item if it already exists for today!
		if (count (every todo in calendar &quot;Personal&quot;  &not;
					whose due date &ge; midnight  &not;
					and summary = summaryText)) &lt; 1 then
			make new todo  &not;
				at end of calendar &quot;Personal&quot;  &not;
				with properties &not;
				({due date:midnight, summary:summaryText})
		end if
	end tell
end createTodo

createTodo(&quot;Fill in time sheet&quot;)
</pre>
