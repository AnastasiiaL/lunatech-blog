https://twitter.com/_JamesWard[James Ward] from Typesafe joined us after
presenting with https://twitter.com/nicolasleroux[Nicolas Leroux]
(Lunatech) at Devoxx UK and Devoxx FR last week.
https://twitter.com/rolandkuhn[Roland Kuhn], Akka tech lead at Typesafe,
travelled from Sweden.

James and Nicolas live-coded a Play framework application that used the
meetup.com API to select a competition winner from the list of
attendees. http://www.meetup.com/010DEV/members/68836872/[Robert Bakker]
won a free place on the
http://lunatech.com/training/play-2-training[Fast Track to Play with
Scala] training course at Lunatech on 30-31 May 2013.

Locus Publicus remains a popular choice of venue, with the facilities
this kind of event needs: a projector, a bar and a great beer selection.
For this event, Lunatech sponsored the beer.

Although we created http://010dev.nl[010DEV] to be a community of
Rotterdam-based developers, this event attracted people from further
afield, including five developers who travelled from Belgium.
