collaboration author: Sietse de Kaper summary:
"[BitBucket](http://www.bitbucket.org) is a source code repository
hosting solution by [Atlassian](http://www.atlassian.com). Besides
repository hosting, it also offers issue tracking and wikis. We are
currently considering BitBucket as a [Gitorious](http://gitorious.org/
\"Gitorious\") replacement." ---

[[structure]]
== Hierarchical structure

The main hierarchical unit in BitBucket is a repository. That’s also the
_only_ level: there’s no grouping of repositories or the notion of a
project. That means if you have 50 repositories, you’ll have to scroll
through the list to find the one you need, which means you’ll be wanting
a strict naming convention. The issue tracker and wiki are
per-repository.

== Repositories

BitBucket supports git and Mercurial source-code repositories.
Repositories belong to a single user, who can give access permissions to
that repository (see below). Users with access to a repository can fork
and/or watch it. Forking allows users to create pull requests for the
original repository.

[[access]]
== Access control

Access to the repositories is configured per-repository, by the owning
user (i.e. the ‘Lunatech’ user). Users can be grouped, and access can be
granted to an individual, or to an entire group. There are three levels
of access: read, read/write, and admin.

BitBucket accounts do not belong to an organisation or other account. In
other words, it’s not possible for us to create or delete users, we can
only give existing BitBucket users access to our repositories. It’s also
not possible to revoke access from all repositories for a single user,
so you would normally grant access to a group instead.

== Wiki

Bitbucket repositories can have a wiki attached. Wiki pages are written
in http://www.wikicreole.org/[Creole] syntax. Pages can be edited by
checking out the wiki as a git repository, or through an editor built
into Bitbucket. There’s a pretty decent Creole editor and preview
functionality.

[[tracker]]
== Issue tracker

A BitBucket repo can have issue tracker. On creation, tickets have
(non-customisable) types and priority, and can be assigned to a user.
Once created, the ticket gets the status ‘new’, which can be changed to
one of open, resolved, invalid, duplicate or wontfix. Milestones,
versions and components can be configured per repository, in which case
they become available as properties on tickets.

== Conclusion

BitBucket is an obvious migration path from JIRA/Confluence to hosted
DVCS with integrated lightweight issue tracker and wiki. Our specific
conclusions are as follows.

* There’s a simple git-based wiki, and Creole is an acceptable syntax
(although Markdown support would be nice).
* There’s a simple issue tracker.
* Not being able to group repositories is a minor inconvenience (solved
by a naming prefix convention).
* There is no way to archive/hide unused repositories, which would be
nice.
* We would have to restrict the admin group to people who are allowed to
access all the contents of all wikis, which would be the very small
group who has access to the most sensitive wiki.
* You would have to log in to a central account to create a private
repo.
* BitBucket’s pricing model is a better fit for our situation (few
users, many repos) than GitHub’s.
* GitHub is more mature, seems to generally do more and have more
development effort behind it.

Our conclusion is therefore that we want to use GitHub, even though it’s
going to cost more and we’ll be limited in the number of repositories.
