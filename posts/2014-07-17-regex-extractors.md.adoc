Sometimes the best way to decompose string data is with capturing groups
in regular expressions. However, using Java’s `java.util.regex` package
is no fun. Fortunately Scala’s `scala.util.matching` package uses Scala
language features to make things a lot easier for you.

== Follow along

Note that the examples shown are from a REPL session and can be
copy-pasted into another Scala REPL. The REPL will figure out what’s
going on, repeat the commands, and ignore the output from the other
session. But note that you have to press ctrl-D when you’re done pasting
before it does anything.

== What do we want to achieve

Let’s say we want to decompose a string containing an e-mail address
into its local and domain parts. The regular expression `(.\*)@(.\*)`
splits an e-mail address into its local (first capture group) and domain
(second) parts.

We’re not trying to fully validate the e-mail address for this example.
If you do plan to properly validate e-mail addresses in your
application, make sure you get it right. There are many web sites out
there that get it wrong — mainly not allowing ``+'' (plus sign) in the
local part, see
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email_address#Local_part[Wikipedia]. Let’s
take it step by step.

== Regular expressions in Scala

In Scala you can easily create a regular expression from a `String` by
calling its `r` method. Since Scala uses Java’s `String` class which
doesn’t contain an `r` method, this method has to come from somewhere
else:
http://scala-lang.org/api/current/#scala.collection.immutable.StringOps[StringOps],
which is an implicit wrapper that adds a bunch of methods to strings.
This means that you can do the following:

....
scala> val Email = "(.*)@(.*)".r
Email: scala.util.matching.Regex = (.*)@(.*)
....

Let’s explain what’s going on here. Calling `r` on a `String` (or any
method on any object that doesn’t have said method) makes the compiler
search for something that is defined as implicit and can turn a `String`
into something that does have an `r` method. Which is what exactly what
`implicit def augmentString(x: String): StringOps` in the `scala.Predef`
package (which is automatically in scope) is.

== Extractors

`r` returns a
http://scala-lang.org/api/current/#scala.util.matching.Regex[Regex]
which contains an `unapplySeq` method. When an object has an
`unapplySeq` (or `unapply`) method, it can be used by the compiler for
pattern matching.

So you can use it as a pattern in a variable definition:

....
scala> val Email(local, domain) = "foo@example.com"
local: String = foo
domain: String = example.com
....

or in a match expression:

....
scala> "foo@example.com" match {
     | case Email(local, domain) => s"Got local [$local], domain [$domain]"
     | case _ => "Got nothing"
     | }
res0: String = Got local [foo], domain [example.com]
....

In both the assignment and the match expression, the compiler now
creates a call to `Regex`’s `unapplySeq` method, passing the string
``foo@example.com'' as the argument. `unapplySeq` returns a list with
the captured values. The values in the returned list are assigned to
`local` and `domain` in the order they were found in the list.

== Naming conventions

You may have noticed that we’re starting the name of a value (`Email`)
with an uppercase letter, which is unusual. Since most Scala developers
— at least the ones I have worked with — apply variable-naming rules to
values in Scala. However, Scala developers also tend to apply naming
rules according to the intended usage. We’re not planning to use `Email`
as a regex directly, but as an extractor, therefore we apply
extractor-naming rules.

== Conclusion

Easy-to-create regexes and extractors make it very easy to write custom
string extractors. Use them to your advantage to write concise and
expressive code. Also, realize that any object with an `unapply` or
`unapplySeq` method can be used as an extractor. Therefore you can write
extractors for anything you want. See section 26.2 in _Programming in
Scala_ for more information.
