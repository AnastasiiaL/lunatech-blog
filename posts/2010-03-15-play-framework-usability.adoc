:title: Play framework usability
:tags: [playframework]

Perhaps the most
striking thing about about the http://www.playframework.org/[Play! framework] 1.0 is that its biggest
advantage over other Java web application development frameworks does
not fit into a neat feature list, and is only apparent after you have
used it to build something. That advantage is usability.

Note that usability is separate from functionality. In what follows, I
am not suggesting that you cannot do this in some other framework: I
merely claim that it is easier and more pleasant in Play! I need to
emphasise this because geeks often have a total blind spot for usability
because they enjoying figuring out difficult things, and
under-appreciate the value of things that Just Work.

[[webdevelopers]]
== Written by web developers for web developers

The first hint that something different is going on here is when you
first hear that the Play! framework is 'written by web developers for
web developers', an unconventional positioning that puts the web's
principles and conventions first and Java's second. Specifically, this
means that the Play! framework is more in line with the W3C's
http://www.w3.org/TR/webarch/[Architecture of the World Wide Web] than
it is with Java Enterprise Edition (Java EE) conventions.

[[urls]]
== URLs for perfectionists

For example, the Play! framework, like other modern web frameworks,
provides first-class support for arbitrary 'clean' URLs, which has
always been lacking from the Servlet API. It is no coincidence that at
the time of writing, link:/2005/07/29/struts-urls[Struts URLs for
perfectionists], a set of work-arounds for the Servlet API-based Struts
1.x web framework, remains the third-most popular out of 160 articles on
_www.lunatech-research.com_ despite being a 2005 article about a
previous-generation Java web technology.

In Servlet-based frameworks, the Servlet API does not provide useful
URL-routing support; Servlet-based frameworks configure `web.xml` to
forward all requests to a single controller Servlet, and then implement
URL routing in the framework, with additional configuration. At this
point, it does not matter whether the Servlet API was ever intended to
solve the URL-routing problem and failed by not being powerful enough,
or whether it was intended to be a lower-level API that you do not build
web applications in directly. Either way, the result is the same: web
frameworks add an additional layer on top of the Servlet API, itself a
layer on top of HTTP.

Play! combines the web framework, HTTP API and the HTTP server, which
allows it to implement the same thing more directly with fewer layers
and a single URL routing configuration. This configuration, like Grails'
and Cake PHP's, reflects the structure of an HTTP request - HTTP method,
URL path, and then the mapping:

....
# Play! 'routes' configuration fileâ€¦

# Method   URL path         Controller

GET        /                Application.index
GET        /about           Application.about
POST       /item            Item.addItem
GET        /item/{id}       Item.getItem
GET        /item/{id}.pdf   Item.getItemPdf
....

In this example, there is more than one controller. We also see the use
of an `id` URL parameter in the last two URLs.

[[servlet]]
== HttpServletRequest

Another example is Play!'s
http://www.playframework.org/@api/play/mvc/Http.Request.html[Http.Request]
class, which is a far simpler than the Servlet API's
http://java.sun.com/javaee/6/docs/api/javax/servlet/http/HttpServletRequest.html[HttpServletRequest]
interface. In addition, Play! uses a class where Java EE 6 uses the Java
EE convention of using an interface. This interface is also split
between `HttpServletRequest` and the more generic
http://java.sun.com/javaee/6/docs/api/javax/servlet/ServletRequest.html[ServletRequest]
interface. This separation may be useful if you want to use Servlets for
things other than web applications, or if you want to allow for the
unlikely possibility of the web changing protocol, but for most of us it
is merely irrelevant complexity. In other words, the Servlet API is
always used with a framework on top these days because it is
sub-optimised for building web applications, which is what all of us
actually use it for. Play! fixes that.

[[usability]]
== Better usability is not just for normal people

Another way of looking at the idea that Play! is by and for web
developers is to consider how a web developer might approach software
design differently to a Java EE developer. When you write software, what
is the primary interface? If you are a web developer, the primary
interface is a web-based user-interface constructed with HTML, CSS and
(increasingly) JavaScript. A Java EE developer, on the other hand, may
consider their primary interface to be a Java API, or perhaps a web
services API, for use by other layers in the system.

This difference is a big deal, because a Java interface is intended for
use by other programmers, while a web user-interface interface is
intended for use by non-programmers. In both cases, good design includes
usability, but usability for normal people is not the same as usability
for programmers. In a way, usability for everyone is a higher standard
than usability for programmers, when it comes to software, because
programmers can cope better with poor usability. This is a bit like the
http://www.designcouncil.org.uk/Case-Studies/All-Case-Studies/OXO-Good-Grips/[Good
Grips] kitchen utensils: although they were originally designed to have
better usability for elderly people with arthritis, it turns out that
making tools easier to hold is better for all users.

The Play! framework is different because the usability that you want to
achieve in your web application is present in the framework itself. For
example, the web interface to things like the framework documentation
and error messages shown in the browser is just more usable. Along
similar lines, the server's console output avoids the pages full of
irrelevant logging and pages of stack traces when there is an error,
leaving more focused and more usable information for the web developer.

Try to imagine a JSF web application producing a stack trace this short.
In fact, Play! goes further: instead of showing the stack trace, the web
application shows the last line of code within the application that
appears in the stack trace. After all, what you really want to know is
where things first went wrong _in your own code_.

This kind of usability does not happen by itself; the Play! framework
goes to considerable effort to filter out duplicate and irrelevant
information, and focus on what is essential.

[[details]]
== Quality is in the details

In the Play! framework, much of the quality turns out to be in the
details: they may be small things individually, rather than big
important features, but they add up to result in a more comfortable and
more productive development experience. The warm feeling you get when
building something with Play! is the absence of the frustration that
usually results from fighting the framework.

We recommend that you go to http://www.playframework.org/, download the
latest binary release, and spend half an hour on the
http://www.playframework.org/documentation/1.0.1/guide1[tutorial].
