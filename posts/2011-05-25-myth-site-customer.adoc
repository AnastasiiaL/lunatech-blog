On 24 May 2011, Peter Hilton gave a
talk about agile software development at a http://talkabout-it.nl/detail/?id=9[Talk About IT event] in Amsterdam. Here are the

The talk described how although agile software development methods
advocate putting the customer (product owner) in the same room as the
development team for the duration of the project, this is not always
possible. The presentation described four case studies of customers who
weren’t ‘in the room’, how this compromised agile software development,
how we communicated with the customer instead, and why Scrum still had
something to offer.
