http://www.eximion.nl/[Eximion] has successfully closed a significant
investment round with http://www.technostars.nl/[TechnoStars] and IT2 Capital Partners
(IT2C). The investment will enable Eximion to release their first 3D
casual games and also to further develop their
http://eximion.blogspot.com/[Kalydo] gaming platform, opening it to
third-party game developers. We expect that the official launch of the
Eximion gaming plaform will take place during the first half of 2008,
introduction of the platform to third-party developers is planned for
the second half of 2008. Watch this space!"
