Recently we started hosting a monthly meetup of
http://www.ehrdclj.org[EHRD.clj].

EHRD.clj is a new meetup for the Clojure enthusiasts in Rotterdam and
the Hague area. We hosted the very succesful
http://www.ehrdclj.org/blog/first-meetup[inaugural meetup] at our office
last month with http://cgrand.net[Christophe Grand] as keynote speaker.

Last wednesday we hosted the second meetup where we discussed various
Clojure-related topics. The meetup has regular features such as _Library
of the month_ and
http://www.ehrdclj.org/blog/this-month-in-clojure-april[_This Month in
Clojure_]. There was also a main talk about http://pedestal.io[Pedestal]
by http://blog.lunatech.com/author/vijay-kiran[yours truly].

We plan to host the event every month and if you are interested in
Clojure, join us by signing up for the
