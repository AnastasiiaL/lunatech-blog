localisation in JSF and Seam" tags: Java Seam author: Peter Hilton
summary: "This article introduces the mechanisms for
[internationalising](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internationalization_and_localization)
a web application built using JavaServer Faces (JSF) application and the
[Seam Framework](http://www.seamframework.org/) for [language
localisation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_localisation)
(L10N), expanding on the brief introduction in the Seam manual,
[Chapter 16. Internationalization, localization and
themes](http://docs.jboss.com/seam/2.1.1.GA/reference/en-US/html/i18n.html)."

[[Simplelabels]]
== Simple labels

In the most simple case, as described in the Seam manual, you define a
user-interface text labels in a properties file for each localisation.

[source,ruby=nogutter]
----
# messages.properties - English localisation
order = Order
----

[source,ruby=nogutter]
----
# messages_fr.properties - French localisation
order = Commande
----

Then display the label in a Facelets view using an Expression Language
(EL) expression that uses the `messages` Seam component.

[source,xml=nogutter]
----
<h1>#{messages.order}</h1>
----

This syntax works, because the `Messages` component exposes a
`java.util.Map` interface, keyed on the message key, which means that
the EL expression above references the message for the Map key `orders`.

[[Dotsinmessagekeys]]
== Dots in message keys

In practice, it is common to define hundreds or thousands of messages
for an application user-interface, and to use a dot-hierarchy notation
for the message keys, to organise them. For example:

[source,ruby=nogutter]
----
model.Order = Order
model.Order.carrierReference = Carrier reference
model.Order.carrierReference.help = e.g. package tracking number.
model.Order.deliveryAddress = Delivery address
model.Order.dueDate = Due date
----

In this case, an expression like `#{messages.model.Order`} will no
longer work: this is parsed as a reference to an `Order` property on the
`#{messages.model`} map entry. If you try this you get the error:

____
javax.el.ELException: /example.xhtml: Property 'Order' not found on type
java.lang.String
____

Instead, you have to use the more explicit Map look-up syntax:

[source,xml=nogutter]
----
<h1>#{messages['model.Order']}</h1>
----

So far, this is pretty neat, in
http://www.askoxford.com/concise_oed/neat[both senses] of the word.

[[Placeholdersinmessages]]
== Placeholders in messages

In the application we are currently building, about a quarter of the
messages contain a placeholder, whose value is inserted dynamically. For
example:

[source,ruby=nogutter]
----
# {0} date format, e.g. yyyy-MM-dd
action.order.orderDate.invalid=Order date must be in {0} format
----

You can replace the placeholder, as per `java.text.MessageFormat`, by
using the JSF `h:outputFormat` tag. Unfortuntely, this is somewhat
verbose:

[source,xml=nogutter]
----
<h:outputFormat value="#{messages['action.order.orderDate.invalid']}">
 <!-- Insert the application date format from the configuration. -->
 <f:param value="#{configuration.dateFormat}"/>
</h:outputFormat>
----

Note that the `outputFormat` tag works independently of the message
look-up mechanism, so you could insert the message directly in its
`value` attribute. For example, you can output the current year in a
Facelets view by using the `MessageFormat` date format style to format
the Seam `currentDatetime` component:

[source,xml=nogutter]
----
<!-- Output the current year -->
<h:outputFormat value="{0,date,yyyy}">
 <f:param value="#{currentDatetime}"/>
</h:outputFormat>
----

[[Thingsyoucannotdo]]
== Things you cannot do in JSF

Sooner or later, you are going to want to do one of the following
things.

* Output a localised label containing a placeholder in an attribute
value in a Facelets view, e.g. my name in the link text of
`<h:commandLink action="#{action.notify}" value="Notify Peter"/>`
* Use a JSF formatter, such as a date formatter, to format a value that
will be inserted into a message placeholder.
* Insert a JSF component, such as an `h:commandLink` into a message
placeholder.

Unfortunately, these are not currently possible with the facilities in
JSF, Seam and Facelets. You can either vote for
https://javaserverfaces-spec-public.dev.java.net/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=517[javaserverfaces-spec-public
issue 517] and wait for a new version of JSF 2, or you can write your
own implementations.
