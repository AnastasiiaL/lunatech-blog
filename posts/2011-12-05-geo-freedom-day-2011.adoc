Lunatech will be at the event http://geofreedomday.nl/[Geo Freedom Day
2011]. The event is cool because we have done
GeoMap related development for our Logistics division in the past and
want to continue monitoring the progress in the field.

Specifically, an interesting presentation will be about the work with
the new Red programming language and the map libraries Champlain and
OMS-GS-map.
