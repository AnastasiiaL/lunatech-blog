Veen summary: "Lunatech will be at the event [Geo Freedom Day
2011](http://geofreedomday.nl/). The event is cool because we have done
GeoMap related development for our Logistics division in the past and
want to continue monitoring the progress in the field." ---

Specifically, an interesting presentation will be about the work with
the new Red programming language and the map libraries Champlain and
OMS-GS-map.
