:tags: [collaboration,methodology]

It is an IT cliché to say that ‘you should speak the customer’s language’, which is like simply declaring that you should speak French to French people. Actually learning to speak French requires continued effort over a long period. Spending some time in France is a good idea as well.

Like speaking French, using the language of our customer’s business
domain is easier said than done. Despite working remotely, years of
daily interaction and frequent `exchange visits' in both directions have
allowed us to think about and discuss supply chains and logistics
process the same way our customer does.

This is one of several ways that actually doing domain-driven design
turns out to be significantly harder in practice than you might first
expect. Our diligence in gaining

chain experience] during the last eighteen years has taught us to speak
the language in more than one way.

In this case our customer actually is in France, North of Paris. We even
speak French to them sometimes.
