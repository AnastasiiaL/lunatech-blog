:title: How to demo the Play framework - live coding script (in Scala)
:tags: [playframework,java]

If you want someone to know how fast and
straightforward it is to build a Scala web application with the http://www.playframework.org/[Play framework], then *show*, don't *tell*.
The most compelling way to do this is to download Play and start coding
a web application from scratch, while they watch. This article is a
script for a five-minute live-coding Play demo.

This script is based on Peter Hilton's demo, but with Scala. See

for more information.

[[Createandruntheapplication]]
== Create and run the application

*Open* http://download.playframework.org/1.1-nightly/ Download one of
the nightly builds for 1.1, unless the final version has already been
released — I used 1.1-unstable-r942. Resist the urge to use any other
version for use with this demo.

____
There is no need to _install_ Play as such, although you might want to
add the download's directory to your `PATH`, so you can execute the
`$PLAY_HOME/play` commmand directly. On my machine, though, it's just as
easy to just type `~/Downloads/play-1.1-unstable-r942/play` for this
kind of demo.
____

*Execute* `play install scala`

*Execute*
`play new tasks --with scala~ What is the application name? tasks`

____
A task list application is an easy example for people to understand, but
it is more fun to pick an example that is more familiar and relevant to
your audience, such as 'customers' or 'cocktails'.
____

*Execute* `find tasks` (optional) - List the generated files

____
It is crucial to note that Play has not generated a lot of code here;
the files are minimal stubs that you will only add to, rather than a lot
of generated code that you will have to delete.
____

*Execute* `play run tasks` - Start the Play server runtime to run the
application.

____
Depending on what you are used to, start-up time may seem extremely
short.
____

*Open* http://localhost:9000/ - Show welcome page.

____
The welcome page describes how the stub application works, which the
next few steps show.
____

*Start* a text editor.

____
You could use an IDE, such as Eclipse, already at this point. However,
it is useful to start with a plain text editor to make it clear that you
do not have to compile the Scala code yourself.

If you are doing this demo with TextMate on a Mac, you can uncomment the
line that starts with `# play.editor`. This will allow you to click on
the sources in Play's error messages to make TextMate jump to the right
place in the file.
____

*Edit* `conf/routes` - Show the route for the `GET /` HTTP request.

____
Since Play has an HTTP focus, an incoming HTTP request is a good
starting point for explaining how it works. The `routes` file, is
therefore crucial, because this defines the (two-way) mapping between
HTTP requests and Scala methods.
____

*Edit* `app/controllers/Application.scala` - Show the `index` method.

*Edit* `app/views/main.html` - Show the default template: HTML 5, CSS
and jQuery.

*Edit* `app/views/Application/index.html` - Show the `#{welcome /`} tag
and replace it with `<h1>Tasks</h1>`.

*Open* http://localhost:9000/ - Show the heading.

[[Showdynamicdatainthetemplate]]
== Show dynamic data in the template

*Edit* `app/views/Application/index.html` - Change the heading to
`<h1>${items}</h1>`.

*Edit* `app/controllers/Application.scala` - Change the `index` method
to the following (omitting a parenthesis).

\{% highlight scala %} def index \{ val items = "Things" render(items }
\{% endhighlight %}

*Open* http://localhost:9000/ - Show the Scala compilation error.

*Edit* `app/controllers/Application.scala` - Add the missing
parenthesis.

*Open* http://localhost:9000/ - Show the Scala changes without
compilation or deployment.

*Edit* `app/controllers/Application.scala` - Replace the `items`
declaration line with an `items: String = "default"` method parameter.

*Open* http://localhost:9000/?items=Things and
http://localhost:9000/?items=Things[http://localhost:9000/] to show the
working default value.

*Edit* `app/controllers/Application.scala` - Undo the last change -
remove the parameter and put the declaration back.

[[Renderingbinarydata]]
== Rendering binary data

*Edit* `app/controllers/Application.scala` - Add a new method.

\{% highlight scala %} import play.libs.Images … def captcha =
Images.captcha \{% endhighlight %}

*Edit* `conf/routes` - Add `GET /captcha Application.captcha`

*Open* http://localhost:9000/captcha - Show the rendered image, show
that the image has the correct mime-type according to the browser.

____
`Images.captcha`, which is part of Play's built-in captcha facilities,
renders a new captcha image for every call.
____

[[Showmessagefilecontentinthetemplate]]
== Show message file content in the template

*Edit* `app/views/Application/index.html` - Change the heading to
`<h1>&{'model.tasks'}</h1>`.

*Open* http://localhost:9000/ - Show the message key being displayed,
because the message is not defined.

*Edit* `conf/messages` - Add the line `model.tasks = Tasks`

*Open* http://localhost:9000/ - Show the message being displayed.

[[Eclipse]]
== Eclipse

*Execute* `Control+C` - Show how little logging there is by default.

*Execute* `play eclipsify tasks` - Generate Eclipse project and class
path configuration.

*Eclipse* _File » Import… » Existing projects into workspace_ - Show
project structure.

*Eclipse* `eclipse/tasks.launch` » Run » tasks - Start the Play server
runtime from within Eclipse.

*Open* http://localhost:9000/ - Show the application running.

[[JPAentity]]
== JPA entity

*Edit* `app/models` - create class:

[source,scala]
----
package models

import javax.persistence.Entity

import play.db.jpa.Model
import play.db.jpa.QueryOn

@Entity
class Task(
   var title: String
) extends Model {
   override def toString = title
}

object Task extends QueryOn[Task]
----

*Edit* `app/controllers/Application.scala` - Change the `index` method
to

[source,scala]
----
import models.Task
…
def index {
   val tasks = Task.findAll
   render(tasks)
}
----

*Edit* `app/views/Application/index.html` - After the heading, add:

[source,html]
----
<ul>
#{list tasks, as:'task'}
   <li>${task.title}</li>
#{/list}
</ul>
----

*Open* http://localhost:9000/ - Show the JPA error.

*Edit* `conf/application.conf` - Uncomment the line `# db=mem`

____
Play needs to be restarted for this to take effect. Press Ctrl+C in the
terminal window running Play and rerun the command `play run tasks`
____

*Open* http://localhost:9000/ - Show the page - no tasks.

[[HTMLform]]
== HTML form

*Edit* `app/views/Application/index.html` - After the list, add:

[source,html]
----
#{form @add()}
<p><input name="task.title"></p> <p><input type="submit" value="Add Task"></p>
#{/form}
----

*Edit* `app/controllers/Application.scala` - Add the method:

[source,scala]
----
def add(task: Task) {
   task.save
   index
}
----

*Open* http://localhost:9000/ - Add tasks.

[[Commandlink]]
== Command link

*Edit* `app/views/Application/index.html` - Inside the `<li>` add a
link:

[source,html]
----
<a href="@{delete(task.id)}">delete</a>
----

____
As for forms, there is also a tag for generating links; this way just
generates the URL.
____

*Edit* `conf/routes` - Add `GET /delete Application.delete`

*Edit* `app/controllers/Application.scala` - Add the method, noting the
`id` parameter:

[source,scala]
----
def delete(id: Long) {
   Task.findById(id).foreach(_.delete())
   index
}
----

The `foreach` idiom is because `findById` returns a Scala `Option` which
can behave like an empty list or one filled with one entry. This means
that you don't have to check for `null` here, the call to `_.delete` is
just never run if no task was found.

*Open* http://localhost:9000/ - Delete tasks - show the link URL and
query string parameter.

== Extensions

*Edit* `app/views/Application/index.html` - Change the heading to:

[source,html]
----
<h1>${tasks.size()} Task${tasks.pluralize()}</h1>
----

*Open* http://localhost:9000/ - Add/delete tasks to show singular and
plural forms.

____
If you are lucky, at this point someone in the audience will be smart
enough to point out that some plurals are not just formed by adding an
's', at which point you can change the example, and show the `pluralize`
method with one or more parameters, e.g.
`${tasks.pluralize(messages.get('task'), messages.get('tasks'))`}
____

[[Formvalidation]]
=== Form validation

*Edit* `models/Task.scala` - Add the `@Required`
(`import play.data.Validators.Required`) annotation to the `title`
field.

*Edit* `app/controllers/Application.scala` - Add the `@Valid` annotation
to the `add` method's `Task` parameter, replace the first line of the
method body (`Task.save`) with the following.

[source,scala]
----
import play.data.validation._
…
if (Validation.hasErrors) {
   Validation.keep
}
else {
   task.save
}
----

*Edit* `app/views/Application/index.html` - before the form, add:

[source,html]
----
#{errors}
    <p style="color:red">${error}</p>
#{/errors}
----

*Open* http://localhost:9000/ - Show the validation error when
submitting an empty name.

____
The validation error is just 'Required', but we can change this.
____

*Edit* `conf/messages` - Add the line
`validation.required = %s is a required field`

*Open* http://localhost:9000/ - Show the new validation error.

____
Now we get the field name, but not as a formatted label.
____

*Edit* `conf/messages` - Add the line `task.title = Task name`

*Open* http://localhost:9000/ - Show the new validation error.

____
This lists validation errors in one place. A better way is to list the
errors next to each field.
____

*Edit* `app/views/Application/index.html` - Replace the errors tag with:

[source,html]
----
#{ifErrors}
    <p style="color:red">Validation failed</p>
#{/ifErrors}
----

… and after the text input, before the closing `</p>` tag, add:


[source,html]
----
<strong style="color:red">#{error 'task.title' /}</strong>
----

*Open* http://localhost:9000/ - Show the new validation error.
