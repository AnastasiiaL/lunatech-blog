:title: Reviewing Play 1.2’s dependency management
:tags: [playframework,maven,java]


Play version 1.2
introduced http://www.playframework.org/documentation/1.2.1/dependency[dependency
management]
to the framework. I'm a big fan of dependency management, and I think
it's a necessary tool for any software project. Play's approach is
pretty elegant and easy to use, but there's a few catches and things I
think they didn't quite get right. This article is a short introduction
and my opinion of what could be better. I'll repeat some of the
information in the manual, but no more than needed to illustrate a few
points. I'll also deliberately ignore a few points (such as module
dependencies), so it's still a good idea to read the manual if you don't
know anything about Play dependency management yet.

[Dependencymanagement%2CPlaystyle]
==  Dependency management, Play-style

With Play being a Java framework, it only makes sense that its
dependency management makes use of http://maven.apache.org[Maven]
repositories. Maven has excellent dependency management, but it's much
more than dependency management, it's a complete build tool. Because
Play is perfectly capable of building its own applications, thank you
very much, it uses the http://ant.apache.org/ivy/[Ivy] library instead.

Maven dependencies are identified by three properties: groupId,
artifiactId and version. For example, version 2.1 of the flexjson
library is identified as artifactId `flexjson`, version 2.1 under the
`net.sf.flexjson` groupId. In Play, this is represented as:
`net.sf.flexjson -> flexjson 2.1`. The list of artifacts your project
depends on are listed in the `dependencies.yml` file of your projects
`conf` directory. Just add them to the `require` property of the YAML
file.

Once you've specified what you need, Play needs to know where to find
it. In an ideal world, every library would be in the Maven central
repository, and Play would just grab it from there. However, there are
plenty of reasons for a library not to be in Maven central. The library
may not meet the
https://docs.sonatype.org/display/Repository/Central+Sync+Requirements[requirements],
you may need a bleeding-edge ("snapshot") version, or the library's
maintainer may just not care about Maven. That's just the most common
reasons for a library not to be in the central repository. Where Maven
and Ivy made it pretty cumbersome to configure an additional repository
to search for dependencies, Play makes it easy: just list them under the
`repositories` property of your dependencies.yml file.

With Play, unlike Maven and Ivy, resolving dependencies is not part of
the build process. Instead, you need to instruct Play to start the
process yourself. It's easy enough; just run `play dependencies`, and
wait. Oh, the whole ‘download the internet’ thing isn't as much of an
issue as it is with Maven, mainly because Play itself doesn't have as
many dependencies as Maven. Play will still need to download transitive
dependencies (that's a fancy way of saying ‘dependencies of
dependencies’) though, so depending on the complexity of the
dependencies it included, the whole process may still take a while.

[FeaturesintroducedbyPlay]
== Features introduced by Play

Play wouldn't be Play if it didn't introduce some features to make your
life easier.

One of the things Play brings to the table is
http://www.playframework.org/documentation/1.2.1/dependency#Dynamicrevisions[more
flexible version definitions]. Where other tools only allow (and force)
you to specify one specific version, Play also allows you to specify +
a minimum and/or maximum version to use. This not only allows you to
automatically use the most up-to-date version of a library, it also
means you're less likely to run into version conflicts, since the
version requirement is less rigid.

Another nifty feature is the ability to specify which dependencies a
custom repository provides. Just list the artifacts under the
repository's `contains` property, and Play will search that repository,
and _only_ that repository for the listed dependencies. This can save a
lot of time, since it means Play won't have to scour each and every
repository it knows about for the artifacts you already know only exist
in a single custom repository. It's a pretty cool concept, but
unfortunately, the implementation of this feature leaves a lot to be
desired.

[Whatwentwrong%28imho%29]
== What went wrong (imho)

Like I said in the introduction, dependency management is a must for me.
Unfortunately, I haven't been able to convince all of my colleagues just
yet. The main reasons not everyone is using dependency management on all
of their project yet are probably the complexity of setting it up (Maven
pom files are a nightmare, Ivy is only slightly better) and the pain of
finding the magic combination of repositories that make all unresolved
dependency errors go away. Play obviously fixes the first obstacle, and
makes a good attempt at making repositories easier to use, but I think
it could have done a better job.

As stated before, all you need to do to tell Play about a repository is
list it under the `repositories` property. However, instead of using the
repositories listed there to resolve any dependencies it couldn't
resolve using the default repository, you have to _tell it what
dependencies are there_ using the `contains` property. It won't use the
repository for anything else. The _contains_ property is flexible enough
to allow wildcards for artifacts under a certain groupId, but you're SoL
if the dependency you want has transitive dependencies outside its own
groupID (unless those dependencies happen to be in the default
repositories). It's a real shame, as the `contains` property for a
repository would have made an excellent _optional_ optimization feature,
since you could tell Play exactly where to find given dependency.
However, as it stands `contains` is a _required_ property in order to
have Play even _use_ the repository, making it a lot less useful, and
managing repositories is now a lot harder than it has to be.

If you're unlucky enough to require a library with lots of transitive
dependencies not in Maven Central, you have to figure out exactly what
transitive dependencies it uses, and instruct Play where to get them
(usually the same repository).

[Examplesituation]
== Example situation

The Play manual uses the jbpm-persistence-jpa dependency to illustrate
how to specify a Maven 2 repository. The JBoss Maven repository happens
to be one of the major repositories that has loads of artifacts that are
not in Maven Central. So I'll use the same example to illustrate the
problem. I actually wanted to use http://sweble.org[Sweble] as an
example, as that was the library I wanted to use when I first ran into
the issue, but that's actually gotten into Maven Central since then,
making the problem go away.

So, for some reason you want to use the jbpm-persistence-jpa library in
your Play application. Since you're a naive optimist, you start by
simply specifying the dependency in `dependencies.yml`:

[source,brush:,plain;,gutter:,false]
----
# Application dependencies

require:
    - play
    - org.jbpm -> jbpm-persistence-jpa 5.0.0> 
----

After running `play dependencies`, you'll get the following warning:

[source,brush:,plain;,gutter:,false]
----
~ *****************************************************************************
~ WARNING: These dependencies are missing, your application may not work properly (use --verbose for details),
~
~   org.jbpm->jbpm-persistence-jpa 5.0.0
~ *****************************************************************************
~
~ Some dependencies are still missing.> 
----

Ok, fair enough. It's not in Maven Central. Let's list the JBoss repo:

[source,brush:,plain;,gutter:,false]
----
# Application dependencies

require:
    - play
    - org.jbpm -> jbpm-persistence-jpa 5.0.0

repositories:
    - jboss:
        type: iBiblio
        root: "http://repository.jboss.org/nexus/content/groups/public-jboss/" 
----

This time, `play dependencies` takes a little longer to _throw the same
error_. Ugh. Have a look at the output for
`play dependencies --verbose`. You'll notice it never even tries to get
anything from the JBoss repository. Okay, this is what I warned you
about: you actually need to tell Play what artifacts you want from the
JBoss repo:

[source,brush:,plain;,gutter:,false]
----
# Application dependencies

require:
    - play
    - org.jbpm -> jbpm-persistence-jpa 5.0.0

repositories:
    - jboss:
        type: iBiblio
        root: "http://repository.jboss.org/nexus/content/groups/public-jboss/"
        contains:
            - org.jbpm -> jbpm-persistence-jpa> 
----

Go ahead, I dare you: run `play dependencies`. Yup. Same error. By now
you probably want to run `play dependencies --verbose` by default.
Somewhere in the output, you'll see something like this:

[source,brush:,plain;,gutter:,false]
----
:::: WARNINGS
    io problem while parsing ivy file: http://repository.jboss.org/nexus/content/groups/public-jboss/org/jbpm/jbpm-persistence-jpa/5.0.0/jbpm-persistence-jpa-5.0.0.pom: Impossible to load parent for file:/Users/sietse/.ivy2/cache/org.jbpm/jbpm-persistence-jpa/ivy-5.0.0.xml.original. Parent=org.jbpm#jbpm;5.0.0]]> 
----

In other words, Ivy has problems reading the parent module for
`jbpm-persistence-jpa`. This had me scratching my head for a while. I
tried to see if it was there (it was), if it was malformed (it wasn't),
or if Ivy has problems reading this type of pom (it doesn't). In the
end, it turns out it has problems because _it never even tries to load
it_. This just seems brain-dead to me. Thankfully, this transitive
dependency is in the same groupId, so we can fix this with a wildcard:

[source,brush:,plain;,gutter:,false]
----
# Application dependencies

require:
    - play
    - org.jbpm -> jbpm-persistence-jpa 5.0.0

repositories:
    - jboss:
        type: iBiblio
        root: "http://repository.jboss.org/nexus/content/groups/public-jboss/"
        contains:
            - org.jbpm -> *> 
----

This time, after waiting for Ivy to download the new transitive deps, we
get a slightly different error:

[source,brush:,plain;,gutter:,false]
----
~ *****************************************************************************
~ WARNING: These dependencies are missing, your application may not work properly (use --verbose for details),
~
~   org.drools->drools-api 5.2.0.M1
~   org.drools->drools-compiler 5.2.0.M1
~   org.drools->drools-persistence-jpa 5.2.0.M1
~   org.drools->drools-core 5.2.0.M1
~ *****************************************************************************>
----

Turns out that our dependency has transitive dependencies (that are not
in Maven Central) that don't fall in the `org.jbpm` groupId. We have to
list them separately. We got lucky this time: they're all in a single
groupId, `org.drools`, so we can just add the whole groupId with a
wildcard:

[source,brush:,plain;,gutter:,false]
----
# Application dependencies

require:
    - play
    - org.jbpm -> jbpm-persistence-jpa 5.0.0

repositories:
    - jboss:
        type: iBiblio
        root: "http://repository.jboss.org/nexus/content/groups/public-jboss/"
        contains:
            - org.jbpm -> *
            - org.drools -> *> 
----

Now, finally, `play dependencies` no longer complains, and you can start
using your new library.

[Conclusion]
== Conclusion

Overall, I still like the Play dependency management mechanism. It
doesn't mix building and dependency management, and the YAML
configuration file is clear and concise. The one thing it got wrong is
the repository management. The _required_ `contains` property really
messes everything up. Because of it, the complex problem area that is
transitive dependencies is exposed, while it could have been nicely
hidden from me. I don't want to know what a certain library need to get
stuff done, I just want to use the library. That's the whole goal of
dependency management – figuring that stuff out for me.

My suggestion to the play devs
(http://play.lighthouseapp.com/projects/57987-play-framework/tickets/952-make-contains-property-for-repositories-in-dependenciesyml-optional[ticket
here]): please make the `contains` property an _optional_ performance
improvement. When I list an additional repository, just use it to try
and resolve artifacts that couldn't be resolved using any of the other
repositories. It would make life so much easier.
