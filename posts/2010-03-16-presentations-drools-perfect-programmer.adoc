link:../media/2010-03-16-presentations-drools-perfect-programmer/perfect-programmer.pdf[In search of the perfect programmer] (PDF,
4.2 MB) is a short presentation, to get things started. This is a
light-hearted look at the diversity of programmer backgrounds, and a
serious point about what that means for programmers, and the people who
hire or manage them. At least the jokes got a few laughs.

Rules (a.k.a. Drools)] (PDF, 639 KB) is a technical introduction to
Drools Expert, the rules engine in JBoss Rules, based on the example of
a simple decision service, and focusing on what the code looks like. The
decision service source code is available from the earlier article
link:/2010/01/04/how-build-decision-service-using-jboss-rules-execution-server[How
to build a decision service using JBoss Rules Execution Server], the
last of three articles that explain the decision service example in more
detail.
