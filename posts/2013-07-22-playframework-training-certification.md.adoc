I have completed Typesafe’s certification process and can now deliver
their Play training course. I even have a nice certificate to hang on
the wall:

certificate]

Lunatech can provide this training course both as a public training
course, in partnership with a training organiser that arranges the
training location and sells tickets, and as a private on-site course for
a customer who wants to train five or more developers at their own
location.

Last week I delivered on-site Play training at
http://rhinofly.nl[Rhinofly]’s office in Utrecht, to enable a whole team
of web developers and front-enders to get up to speed with Play so they
can use Play and Scala to build web applications.

My next public training course will be at Mejsla’s office in Stockholm
on 24 September 2013 -

Although Play is relatively easy to get started with, it is a full-stack
framework that brings together many technologies and web development
topics, from HTTP APIs, JSON processing, Ajax, asset pipelines and
database access. The value of this training course is that it gives you
a solid grounding in the basics, to allow you to start a project
productively, and introduces you to a broader range of topics so that
you understand the options for building a web application.

And if that wasn’t enough to persuade you to sign up for a training
course, each attendee also gets a free copy of the book -
