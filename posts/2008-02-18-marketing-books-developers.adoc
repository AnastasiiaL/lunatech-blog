:title: Marketing books for developers
:tags: [opinion,book]

To a software developer, 'marketing' is more likely to be a department
that another kind of people belong to, than an activity that everyone
should participate it. This could be because people outside The
Marketing Department are actually forbidden from involvement, or even
because of the http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Dilbert_animated_series_episodes[Dilbert TV
series]
episode where he accidentally destroys a successful company by
introducing a marketing department. Although no single book is likely to
restore this disastrous reputation among developers, there are at least
a few good ones that entertain while broadening the picture a little.

http://www.cluetrain.com/book.html[The Cluetrain Manifesto], also
http://www.cluetrain.com/book/[available on-line], is a good place to
start simply because its revolutionary take on marketing and the web
presents such an opposite perspective. This witty and provocative
collection of essays does much to argue first that marketing on the web
can be different from the traditional marketing approaches that we have
learned to hate, and second that it has to be different in order to be
even remotely successful.

http://www.amazon.com/Gonzo-Marketing-Winning-Through-Practices/dp/0738204080[Gonzo
Marketing: Winning Through Worst Practices] provides far more of the
same, from Chris Locke, the most in-your-face of the Cluetrain authors.
This book is more lengthy and drags on somewhat, but does a good job of
developing many of the anti-marketing ideas further, finding time to
dish out far more insults and entertainment along the way. Of the four
books, this is the one to skip first.

http://www.insearchofstupidity.com/[In Search of Stupidity, over 20
years of high-tech marketing disasters] contrasts Cluetrain's vision for
the future of marketing with episodes from IT marketing's history that
were such failures that they are actually funny. The essential thesis of
this book is that so many successful companies have killed themselves
off by eventually making a single fatal marketing mistake and sticking
to it, that the more humble goal of merely avoiding disaster would be a
good start.

http://www.guykawasaki.com/books/rules.shtml[Rules for Revolutionaries]
continues this humility, while adding actual positive advice whose
humour is centred around Apple Computer's marketing over the years.
These stories and rules from techie-friendly Guy Kawasaki are also very
readable and entertaining, and manage to hint at a more positive role
for marketing, as an activity. It is possible that Rules would manage to
do this even if you had not been softened up by Cluetrain and Stupidity,
and its accessible format and shorter length make it the one book to
read if you want to skip the others, but I suspect that most software
developers are far too cynical to take this stuff at face value without
some preparation.

I am not sure where my ongoing marketing education goes from here;
perhaps there is an argument out there that a traditional marketing
department makes some sense after all, at least some of the time, but I
have not heard it yet.
