This article
describes a functional programming puzzle that we had to solve in order
to implement a JavaScript templating system. It is a very simple problem
(to explain), with a very simple solution (in size and complexity) that
was not easy to find. We will describe the problem and its solution here
because it is not specific to JavaScript (it is mostly
functional-language neutral) and the solution has been a
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eureka_(word)[eureka] moment to most
people who found it or learned about it." ---

Although this article will be easier to read if you have a functional
programming background (and/or are advanced JavaScript programmers), we
will do our best to introduce procedural programmers into the problems
and techniques described.

[[Afunctionalprogrammingpuzzle-Theproblem]]
== The problem

The problem at hand is pretty straightforward: We want to write a
JavaScript templating system that lets me define new variables in
_environments_ (lexical scopes) that we can manipulate.

[[Afunctionalprogrammingpuzzle-Aboutlexicalscopes]]
=== About lexical scopes

An example will help explaining. Suppose the following syntax directly
stolen from Groovy templates in the Play framework:

[source,brush:,html;,gutter:,false]
----
#{list items:[1,2,3], var: 'i'}
 #{list items:[4,5], var: 'j'}
  ${i * j}
 #{/list}
#{/list}
----

In this example, there are two `list` tags, which iterate over a list
and define a new variable inside their lexical scope, to hold the
current iteration value. You can think of them exactly as the Java (and
many other languages) `foreach`:

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false]
----
for(int i : new int[]{1,2,3}){
 for(int j : new int[]{4,5}){
  System.out.println(i * j);
 }
}
----

In a lexical scope you can only access variables defined in the current
scope or the scopes that contain your scopes lexically. In Java you
would say you can only see variables defined in the current block, or
containing blocks (plus arguments, fields and statics). Once you get out
of a lexical scope, all the variables of that scope become _unbound_
(undefined).

[[Afunctionalprogrammingpuzzle-Whyweneedtodealwithscopes]]
=== Why we need to deal with scopes

Now, suppose we want to implement the previous templating example in
JavaScript. We need to be able to:

. evaluate the first list "[1,2,3]"
. define a new scope `s1` where `i := 1`
. evaluate the second list "[4,5]" in the `s1` scope
. define a new scope `s2`, which extends `s1`, where `j := 4`
. evaluate "i * j" in the `s2` scope
. get back to the `s1` scope (when the inner list terminates)
. get back to the initial scope (when the outer list terminates)

And the only tool we possess in JavaScript for evaluating an expression
is `eval(s)` which evaluates a string as JavaScript code and returns the
value of the evaluation.

Other functional languages (yes JavaScript is a functional programming
language) let you define environments and pass them to `eval` (such as
http://www.schemers.org/Documents/Standards/R5RS/HTML/r5rs-Z-H-9.html#%_sec_6.5[Scheme]),
but not JavaScript.

Because JavaScript’s `eval` does not let us deal with environments, we
have to do it ourselves. Of course writing a new evaluator is out of the
question, so we´ll have to use _our brains_ to find a solution.

[[Afunctionalprogrammingpuzzle-Thehuntforthesolution]]
== The hunt for the solution

Now that we have explained the problem, let us say that we need a
function that takes in some code as text (either an expression, or a
statement) and an environment, and returns either the expression’s
evaluated value (for an expression), or a new environment (in the case
of a statement).

At this point you can stop reading this article if you want to solve the
puzzle yourself, then come back here later to either check that your
working solution is the same one (we’re interested in other solutions),
or to read hints that should help you find the solution.

The rest of the article describes iterations that led to our solution.

[[Afunctionalprogrammingpuzzle-Howtocaptureanenvironment]]
=== How to capture an environment

We will begin with a quick explanation of a technique often used by
JavaScript developers who may not know its name or how it works exactly.

In JavaScript, you only have two scopes: global scope and lexical scope.
Whenever you enter a function you extend the current environment with
new variables. You can think of the current environment as a linked list
of all the containing lexical scopes: from the innermost function until
the outermost function. Whenever you access a variable, that variable is
looked up in the current environment (the containing function), and if
that variable is not defined there, it will be looked up in the parent
environment (the function containing the current function), and again
all the way until either we find that varible in a parent containing
function, or until the global environment.

Let us illustrate this with an example:

[.image-wrap]#image:capture-environment.png[image]#

In this example we define a function `foo` which declared one
`outerParam` variable, then returns a new function which defines one
`innerParam` variable. When we invoke `foo(2)` we get inside the
function with a current environment (we can name it `e1`) which binds
the `outerParam` variable to `2`, then we return the inner function and
store it in `a`.

That inner function keeps a reference to its environment (`e1`) for when
we will invoke it, because the code of that inner function references a
variable bound in `e1`. This is called _capturing the environment_.

When we then invoke that function with `a(3)`, we create a new
environment (let´s name it `e2`) which extends the captured `e1` with
the variable `innerParam` bound to `3`.

[[Afunctionalprogrammingpuzzle-Findingthegeneralidea]]
=== Finding the general idea

JavaScript’s `eval` always evaluates the code in the current lexical
scope, which means that any variable you define inside the `eval` will
only be visible in the current scope, which is not something we can
manipulate.

On the other hand, we know of a way to define a new scope: defining a
new function. You can define a new function and return it outside of
`eval` and it will _capture_ that variable. Because when we capture the
environment, we can exit the current lexical scope and yet keep a
reference to the environment (and all defined variables therein) which
we can use later. You can manipulate a function, so this is good, we’re
getting somewhere.

Let us try to see how we can define a new scope where `i = 2*6` and we
can retrieve that variable later on.

[source,brush:,javascript;,gutter:,false]
----
function evalInEnv(){
  return eval("(function (){ var i = 2*6; return i; })");
}
var capturedEnvironment = evalInEnv();
assertEquals(12, capturedEnvironment());
----

The `evalInEnv` function returns a function, which represents our
captured environment. We later invoke this function to get values out of
the captured environment. We’re getting somewhere, we’ve found that an
environment has to be a function.

[[Afunctionalprogrammingpuzzle-Dealingwithsideeffects]]
=== Dealing with side-effects

Now the problem with our first solution is that the environment is not
really captured, what we’ve done here is _defer_ evaluation of `2*6`,
but every time we’re going to invoke our environment to get the value of
`i`, we are going to re-evaluate `2*6`. This is very bad because if we
replace `2*6` with something that has side-effects, we are going to
trigger the side-effect every time we access `i`.

Let us illustrate the side-effect problem with a global variable we
increment:

[source,brush:,javascript;,gutter:,false]
----
var c = 0;
function evalInEnv(){
  return eval("(function (){ var i = c++; return i; })");
}
var capturedEnvironment = evalInEnv();
assertEquals(0, capturedEnvironment());
assertEquals(1, capturedEnvironment());
----

So we have to store the variable first, and then return a function that
captures it. In order to do that we need a first scope where we define
the variable, and we can do this in JavaScript by declaring a function
and invoking it immediately with this syntax: `(function(){ … })()`.
There is nothing mystical here, we’re merely:

. defining a new function: function()\{ … }
. wrapping it into an expression by surrounding it with parenthesis:
`(f)`
. invoking the function by appending parenthesis: `(f)()`

This gives us:

[source,brush:,javascript;,gutter:,false]
----
var c = 0;
function evalInEnv(){
  var code = "(function (){ "
   + " var i = c++; "
   + " return function (){ return i; }"
   + "})()";
  return eval(code);
}
var capturedEnvironment = evalInEnv();
assertEquals(0, capturedEnvironment());
assertEquals(0, capturedEnvironment());
----

[[Afunctionalprogrammingpuzzle-Extractingwhatwewantfromtheenvironment]]
=== Extracting what we want from the environment

Our previous example is a good start but we want to be able to use any
statement (`var i = c++;`) and evaluate any expression (`i`) in the new
environment, so we can extend our previous example with additional
parameters:

[source,brush:,javascript;,gutter:,false]
----
function evalInEnv(statement, expression){
  var code = "(function (){ "
   + statement
   + " return function (){ return " + expression + "; }"
   + "})()";
  return eval(code);
}
----

But this is stupid, because we’ve limited ourselves into being able to
extract only a fixed expression for any given statement. We want smarter
environments where once we execute a statement, we can evaluate any
expressions inside that environment, so we have to move the `expression`
parameter from `evalInEnv` to the environment that it returns:

[source,brush:,javascript;,gutter:,false]
----
function evalInEnv(statement){
  var code = "(function (){ "
   + statement
   + " return function (expression){ return eval(expression); }"
   + "})()";
  return eval(code);
}
var c = 0;
var capturedEnvironment = evalInEnv("var i = c++;");
assertEquals(0, capturedEnvironment("i"));
assertEquals(0, capturedEnvironment("i"));
// and to illustrate that we can modify the environment
assertEquals(1, capturedEnvironment("++i"));
assertEquals(2, capturedEnvironment("++i"));
----

[[Afunctionalprogrammingpuzzle-Extendinganenvironment]]
=== Extending an environment

So we can define a new environment and evaluate any expression inside
that environment, as well as modify that environment, but how do we
extend one? In our requirements we want to be able to extend an
environment with new variables and that is not possible with our current
solution.

If we want our environment to be able to handle statements as well as
expressions, we have to add a new parameter which tells us if we are
evaluating an expression or a statement. And hey, since we already have
some code that evaluates statements, let’s use recursion for that case:

[source,brush:,javascript;,gutter:,false]
----
function evalInEnv(statement){
  var environmentFunction = "function (code, isExpression) {"
   + " if(isExpression) return eval(code);"
   + " else return evalInEnv(code)"
   + "}";
  var code = "(function (){ "
   + statement
   + " return " + environmentFunction
   + "})()";
  return eval(code);
}
var c = 0;
var e1 = evalInEnv("var i = c++;");
assertEquals(0, e1("i", true));
assertEquals(0, e1("i", true));
// and to illustrate that we can modify the environment
assertEquals(1, e1("++i", true));
assertEquals(2, e1("++i", true));
// now let's extend the environment
var e2 = e1("var j = i;", false);
assertEquals(2, e2("j", true));
----

If you try to run this you’ll get the following error when you try to
extend the environment:

....
ReferenceError: i is not defined
....

Why do we get this error? Because of recursion. The `i` variable is
_bound_ in the lexical scope of the function in `e1`, but as soon as
this function invokes `evalInEnv` it moves into a new lexical scope:
that of a new call to `evalInEnv`. When using recursion in
lexically-scoped variables, the variables _bound_ in the _caller_
function are not bound in the _callee_ function. This is actually part
of the definition of a lexical scope.

So we can´t use recursion for extending the environment and we´re stuck.

=== [#Afunctionalprogrammingpuzzle-Theeurekamoment]####The _eureka_ moment

Of course we can allow for `X` levels of extending the environment by
not using recursion but using a manual version of a technique called
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inline_expansion[inline expansion]: by
manually adding the code of `evalInEnv` as many times as needed inside
the body of `environmentFunction` instead of using recursion. But this
is a manual process that limits us to `X` levels of environment
extension, where `X` is the number of times we’ve manually copied the
code.

Unless… instead of using recursion and manual inlining, we use automatic
inlining using a different kind of recursion. Since we want to inline
the code of a function, let’s make that function return its code instead
of evaluating it. This way we can use recursion to inline it infinitely
in a lexical scope that is extended every time we need to extend the
environment.

Let’s redefine our evaluator thus:

[source,brush:,javascript;,gutter:,false]
----
function evalInEnv(code, isExpression){
  var environmentFunction = "function (code2, isExpression2) {"
   + " return eval(evalInEnv(code2, isExpression2));"
   + "}";
  var body;
  if(isExpression)
   body = "return ("+code+");";
  else
   body = code
   + " return " + environmentFunction + ";"
  // return our code, do not evaluate it
  return "(function(){" + body + "})()";
}
var c = 0;
// since it now returns code, we have to bootstrap it here
var e1 = eval(evalInEnv("var i = c++;"));
assertEquals(0, e1("i", true));
assertEquals(0, e1("i", true));
// and to illustrate that we can modify the environment
assertEquals(1, e1("++i", true));
assertEquals(2, e1("++i", true));

// now let's extend the environment
var e2 = e1("var j = i;", false);
assertEquals(2, e2("j", true));

// let's make sure "i" is also visible in e2
assertEquals(2, e2("i", true));

// and let's make sure "j" is not visible in e1
try{
 e1("j", true);
 assertFail();
}catch(e){
 assertTrue(e instanceof ReferenceError);
}
----

This is it. It works, it’s cross-browser since it conforms to a standard
JavaScript feature that was already supported in IE6 and with that you
can implement an `eval` with first-class environments.

[[Afunctionalprogrammingpuzzle-Usingthatsolution]]
=== Using that solution

So let’s say the initial environment is one where you did not define any
variable:

[source,brush:,javascript;,gutter:,false]
----
// let's use a random expression to bootstrap our environment
var initialEnvironment = eval(evalInEnv("42", true));
----

Now you can extend the current environment using a stack of environments
to represent the current lexical scope:

[source,brush:,javascript;,gutter:,false]
----
var lexicalScope = [initialEnvironment];

function currentEnvironment(){
 return lexicalScope[lexicalScope.length-1];
}

function extendEnvironment(statement){
 var currentEnvironment = currentEnvironment();
 lexicalScope.push(currentEnvironment(statement, false));
}
----

And you can evaluate any expression in the current environment:

[source,brush:,javascript;,gutter:,false]
----
function evaluateExpression(expression){
 var currentEnvironment = currentEnvironment();
 return currentEnvironment(expression, true);
}
----

And when you’re done with the current environment, when you get out of
the current lexical scope, you can get back to the outer environment:

[source,brush:,javascript;,gutter:,false]
----
function popEnvironment(){
 lexicalScope.pop();
}
----

[[Afunctionalprogrammingpuzzle-Conclusion]]
== Conclusion

We have shown a technique for extending JavaScript’s `eval` with a
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reification_(computer_science)[reified]
environment which allows us to define new environments, extend, drop,
modify and access them, by using a mix of recursion and inlining to
achieve our goal in a cross-browser implementation that is minimal in
size and complexity.

In terms of performance we have to remember that JavaScript’s `eval` is
not any more costly than loading a `<script>` element since the
JavaScript engine uses the same mechanism. The only difference in
execution frequency is that most `<script>` evaluation is done only
once, while we do this every time we extend the environment, so it could
be an expensive solution, but one that in practice does not show any
performance penalty in our tests.

In terms of heap size this process is not any more costly than standard
recursion, though it is more costly in terms of code segment size, even
though the code generated by our recursion/inlining technique is fairly
small and limited to the number of scopes used in the environment.

We do not know if the recursion/inlining technique we used has been
found and/or named before, and we certainly never came across it before,
so even if it’s old news, it was very gratifying to reinvent it.

We believe this technique can be reused in every functional language
that supports `eval` within the current lexical scope.

To get back to the original goal of implementing JavaScript templates,
it is of course entirely possible to implement templates by compiling
them to JavaScript code. We can do this using the `with` statement to
simulate new environments, and this leads to faster code since the
statements and expressions are only compiled once. But not reifying the
environment prevents such templates from capturing it for delaying
nested parts of the template (futures) or repeated evaluation of such
nested parts (reevaluate some part every `X` seconds), both of which are
features of our templating system.

Oh, and of course, we’ve published our JavaScript client-side templating
system, it’s called http://stampsjs.org[Stamps.js] and it’s open-source.

Check it out, this piece of magic code is used in there.
