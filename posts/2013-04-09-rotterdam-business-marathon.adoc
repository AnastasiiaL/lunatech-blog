Coming Sunday nearly the half of Lunatechâ€™s staff will participate in
the Rotterdam marathon. Two teams of four will run in the
http://www.marathonrotterdam.nl/business-runs/business-estafette-marathon[Business
Relay Marathon] and complete together the distance of 42.195km. During
last few months we have been perfecting our form together to make sure
we will enjoy crossing the finish line.

Even though running has little to do with our everyday business there
are some similarities between running a marathon and being a software
developer. Having a good mentor will help you to become better while
going as fast a possible is usually a bad idea because you might not
reach the finish. Choosing the right tools will make you more efficient
but be always realistic regardless how confident you feel. And most of
all, have fun! Doing something you dislike for a long time will make you
miserable.
