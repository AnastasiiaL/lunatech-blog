:title: URL-centric web application design
:tags: [web-applications]

One good way to start
building a web application is to plan its HTTP interface - its URLs.
This URL-centric design is an alternative to a data model-centric design
that starts with the application’s data, or a UI-centric design that is
based on how users will interact with the application’s user-interface.
URL-centric design is a kind of API design.

[[design]]
== URL-centric design

URL-centric design means identifying your application’s resources, and
operations on those resources, and creating a series of URLs that
provide HTTP access to those resources and operations. Once you have a
solid URL design, you can add a user-interface layer on top of this HTTP
interface, and add a model that backs the HTTP resources.

For example, suppose we are designing a web based product catalogue. We
start by identifying a ‘product details’ resource - information about a
product, as well as links to related operations. Two related operations
such as ‘get product details’ and ‘add comment to product details’.

[source,brush:,plain;,gutter:,false]
----
GET /product/5010255079763
POST /product/5010255079763/comments
----

This kind of resource is typically more coarse-grained than the entities
in a data model: ‘product details’ may span multiple database tables.
Similarly, the operations are higher level than the
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete[CRUD]
operations that we tend to think of, for database records.

[[architect]]
== The architect

Whether you are inclined to adopt this approach to application design
depends on your background. In the past, enterprise application
development has focused more on data models, while consumer software is
often more user-interfaction oriented. However, the relatively recent
trends towards
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service-oriented_architecture[service-oriented
architecture] and
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer[REST
architecture] have encouraged more application architects to think in
terms of APIs.

URL-centric design only starts to seem like an obvious approach when you
think of ‘the web’ as the pervasive ecosystem where software runs,
whether it is the public Internet World-Wide Web or a corporate
intranet. If you imagine that it would be useful for web-based stuff
(both applications and documents) to be able to link to each others
pages (HTTP resources), then you inevitably realise that it will help if
their URLs are designed and perhaps even predictable, rather than
random.

[[api]]
== The API

The idea that applications might link to each other naturally leads to
the idea to APIs that let you implement more interesting operations than
merely directing a reader to another web page. This is the key benefit
of URL-centric design: that you can create a consistent public API for
your application that is more stable than either the physical data model
represented by its model classes, or the user-interface generated by its
view templates.

This is especially useful if the HTTP API is the basis for more than one
external interface. For example, your application might have a plain
HTML user-interface, a JavaScript-based user-interface that uses Ajax to
access the server’s HTTP interface, as well as arbitrary HTTP clients
that use your HTTP API directly.

== REST

This is an API-centric perspective on your application in which you
consider that HTTP requests will not necessarily come from your own
application’s web-based user-interface. In particular, this is the most
natural approach if you are designing a REST-style HTTP API, as
described in chapter 5 - ‘Designing Read-Only Resource-Oriented
Services’ - of the book
_http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596529260.do[RESTful Web Services]_
(highly recommended). This describes a detailed procedure that can be
summarised as follows.

. Identify resources.
. Name each resource with a URI.
. Expose each resource using a subset of HTTP’s uniform interface (HTTP
methods).
. Design resource representations to send over HTTP, typically HTML, XML
or JSON.
. Use hyperlinks and forms to connect resources to each other.

You can apply this approach to an application whose only external
interface is a web-based (HTML) user-interface, since URL-centric design
is really just part of REST architectural design. In the case of a
simple web application, with no external API, the only difference to the
general case is that the representations that the server sends to the
client are HTML documents, and the representations that the client sends
to the server are encoded HTML form data.

== Conclusion

URL-centric design offers benefits when used in addition to a more
traditional approach based on the data model, and the more recent trend
towards starting with the user-interface. Designing your application’s
URL-based public HTTP interface creates a clean separation between
client and server, which can be the basis for supporting multiple client
devices, such as a combination of desktop and mobile web interfaces. The
same interface can also be the basis of an REST API used in a
service-oriented architecture.
