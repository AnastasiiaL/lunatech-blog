http://www.wikinomics.com/[Wikinomics] is a book about the mass
web-based collaboration that has emerged in the last few years. It
explains well-known phenomena such as Wikipedia and Flickr, as well as
new kinds of business such as
http://www.innocentive.com/[InnoCentive], which introduces a
peer-to-peer model to scientific research.

The only annoyance is the book's relentless repetition of the key
points, as if it were not a fairly simple idea, so although I recommend
the book, you should skip half of it.
