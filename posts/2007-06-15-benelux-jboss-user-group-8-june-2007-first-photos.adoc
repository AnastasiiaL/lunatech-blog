On 8 June, we hosted https://blog.lunatech.com/posts/2007-05-24-jboss-benelux-user-group-8-june-2007[our first JBoss User Group
meeting] for this part
of the world. The event was extremely sociable, and there were two great
presentations, so we all met lots of people, had some fun and learned
about some JBoss-related technology. Here are some photos from the
event.
