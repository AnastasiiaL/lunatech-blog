event author: Nicolas Leroux summary: "I just came back from
[RivieraDEV](http://rivieradev.fr), located on the French Riviera.
Lunatech sponsored this nice and sunny conference. There were load of
good talks and [Nicolas Martignole](http://www.touilleur-express.fr/)
and myself - the Nicolases â„¢ - gave a presentation about [Play!
framework](http://playframework.org) with some really nice demos. One of
the demo showed a video chat. " ---

The presentation's video should be available pretty soon, stay tuned!

Highlight of the conference were probably the
http://jashkenas.github.com/coffee-script/[Coffeescript] presentation by
http://bodil.tv/[Bodil Stokke] and the http://github.com[Github]
presentation by http://zachholman.com/[Zach Holman]. I hope to be
invited next year - this year was easy since I helped organised the
conference ;). Big thanks to Stephane, Yannis and all the RivieraDEV
team.

PS: I left my phone in Rotterdam, so although it was nice and quiet, I
did not get any pictures of the event.
