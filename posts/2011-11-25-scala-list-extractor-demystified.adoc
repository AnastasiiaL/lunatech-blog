author: Francisco José Canedo Dominguez summary: "This article explains
and demystifies Scala list extraction, which is a technique for
extracting lists from larger lists." ---

In Scala code, you'll often come across list extraction, as in, for
example, a pattern in a variable definition:

[source,brush:,scala;,gutter:,false]
----
scala> val head :: tail = List(1,2,3) // <--
head: Int = 1
tail: List[Int] = List(2, 3)
----

or the second pattern (case) in this simple implementation of map:

[source,brush:,scala;,gutter:,false]
----
def map[A, B](list: List[A])(func: A => B): List[B] = list match {
  case Nil => Nil
  case head :: tail => func(head) :: map(tail)(func) // <--
}
----

What's happening is that we're deconstructing a list into its head and
tail components using the ‘`head :: tail`’ pattern; in both cases
‘`head`’ becomes the first element of the list and ‘`tail`’ becomes a
list that contains the remaining elements of the list. In the first
example the head is the `Int` with value 1 and the tail a list of `Int`
with the values 2 and 3 or rather, the list's first element and the
rest.

You might be asking yourself ‘_what's going on here, is this a trick in
the language?_’ It's not, it's a language feature that everyone can use.

[[TheScalaListextractordemystified-Howitworks]]
== How it works

You can figure out what's going on from the source of the collections
library. But first you need to know the following things:

* ‘`head :: tail`’ in a pattern, is the infix version of
‘`::(head, tail)`’
* a pattern like ‘`::(head, tail)`’ results in a call to
‘`::.unapply(selector)`’, where ‘selector’ is the left-hand-side of a
match expression (‘`list`’ before ‘`match`’ in the second example) or
the right-hand-side of a variable definition (‘`List(1,2,3)`’ in the
first). `unapply` is supposed to return an `Option` of tuple whose
values are assigned to ‘`head`’ and ‘`tail`’ respectively

`unapply` (like `apply`) is one of those methods that the Scala compiler
will use without the method being named and is used specifically for
deconstructing objects in pattern matching. This means that there must
be a `::` object defined somewhere with an `unapply` method, whose
definition is:

[source,brush:,scala;,gutter:,false]
----
object :: {
  def unapply[A](value: List[A]): Option[(A, List[A])] = { … }
  …
}
----

There is no such thing. So, what's going on here?

[[TheScalaListextractordemystified-Exploringcaseclasses]]
== Exploring case classes

It turns out that there's a *case* class called
http://www.scala-lang.org/api/2.9.1/scala/collection/immutable/$colon$colon.html[::]
(in the `scala.collection.immutable` package) that extends `List`. One
of the many neat things that case classes give you, is a synthetic
companion object with an `unapply` method that can deconstruct instances
of that type, for free.

This means that any case class automatically gets everything you need to
be able to both construct and deconstruct an instance. Without having to
type any boilerplate. For example, you could do the following in the
http://www.scala-lang.org/node/2097[Scala REPL]:

[source,brush:,scala;,gutter:,false]
----
scala> case class Person(handle: String, name: String) // define the class
defined class Person

scala> val person = Person("paco", "Francisco") // construct an instance; look mum, no ‘new’
person: Person = Person(paco,Francisco)

scala> val Person(handle, name) = person // deconstruct it
handle: String = paco // a new val with the handle from the person object
name: String = Francisco // and a new val with the name

scala> val handle2 Person name2 = person // and again with infix notation, which looks rather silly in this case
handle2: String = paco
name2: String = Francisco
----

There, with one line of code, we've created a `Person` class that has a
synthetic unapply method that can deconstruct a `Person` instance into
its components. Just like a `List`.

[[TheScalaListextractordemystified-Mysterysolved]]
== Mystery solved

Lists can be deconstructed with `::` because there is an appropriate
case class for that. ‘_Hold on,_’ you say, ‘_doesn't this mean that
deconstructing something with `::` will only work with instances of
`::`?_’ Well, you're right, if you can deconstruct `List(…)` with `::`,
that must mean that a `List` is, somehow, an instance of `::`.

Looking at the source code of the collections library, you'll see that
all the methods that instantiate a ‘`List`’, actually return an instance
of `::`. It's just that `::`'s toString method insists that it's a
`List`, cheeky.

== Conclusion

Scala gives you features that help you (and library makers) to build
powerful and concise APIs. Although I wouldn't recommend that everyone
start using punctuation characters to name their classes. Learn more
