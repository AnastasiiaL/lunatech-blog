:tags: [ventures]

Lunatech Ventures has just launched http://plancruncher.com/[Plan
Cruncher], which helps you create a better
business plan. The Plan Cruncher web application was designed and built
by http://www.lunatech-research.com/[Lunatech Research] for Lunatech
Ventures, in a typical example of the close collaboration between our
software development and investment activities. 

== What Plan Cruncher does

Plan Cruncher creates a standard one-page summary of a business plan for
a start-up company that is looking for external investment. You do this
by choosing icons that represent some of the standard answers that a
business plan must provide.These icons fulfill the same purpose as the
icons for the http://creativecommons.org/about/licenses/[Creative
Commons licenses] - they serve as abbreviations for fairly
straightforward ideas such as 'advertising revenue model', which are
backed up by a long detailed description (in your actual business plan).

== Why investors want entrepreneurs to use Plan Cruncher

Plan Cruncher saves investors’ time. To investors, business plans all
look more or less the same, which is not necessarily abad thing, and
they are always too long, which is. Before an investor decides to wade
into your ten or twenty-page document, he wants straight answers to a
few basic questions about your plan.Plan Cruncher generates a standard
one-page summary that investors can use to screen business plans and
compare them to each other.

== How Plan Cruncher helps you write a better business plan

Plan Cruncher’s icons remind you which questions your business plan must
answer.

. Are you ambitious? Can you build a business?
. Do you have the skills to build the product or service?
. Can you already demo the product?
. Have you worked out how to monetise the product?
. How much investment capital do you need?
. Do you have a revenue forecast?
. How long will it take to reach profitability?

If your plan’s executive summary is good, it can answer these questions
in less than 30 seconds. Plan Cruncher gives you that summary.

== Example - you are working on a great new idea

A revolutionary new idea that you are building yourself…You have a team
that can build it…You have a prototype you can demo…You are gathering
users… and need an investment to develop the product to the point where
you charge them for the service.

== Example - a lot of hot air and a totally unrealistic valuation

image:../media/2010-03-03-plan-cruncher/idea-nda.png[image,title="We want you to sign an NDA"]image:../media/2010-03-03-plan-cruncher/product-vapourware.png[image,title="The product is vapourware"]image:../media/2010-03-03-plan-cruncher/revenue-question.png[image,title="We do not know how to monetise this"]image:../media/2010-03-03-plan-cruncher/team-build-not.png[image,title="We cannot build it"]image:../media/2010-03-03-plan-cruncher/partnership-offer-10.png[image,title="We offer 10 per cent of the company"]

The idea is all you have, so you want us to sign an NDA… You do not know
how you are going make money… You want to use someone else’s money to
build it… So basically you have nothing, but have somehow come up with a
valuation where 10% is the funding you need.
