:tags: [ventures]

VisibleLogistics has today unveiled their
integration with eBay for power sellers. After a sale has been completed
on the eBay system, the order is immediately transferred to
VisibleLogistics. From there on both the seller and buyer have all the
advantages the VisibleLogistics platform has to offer (order visibility,
notifications and tracking to name a few). 

Sign-up for sellers is easy and instant. Read more at
