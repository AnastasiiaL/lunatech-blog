:title: Development - Ernst & Young Indirect Tax
:tags: [case-study]


http://www.ey.com/NL/en/Services/Tax/Indirect-Tax[Ernst & Young Indirect Tax] selected Lunatech to design and build a new online tax advice product. In the first phase, Lunatech quickly developed a working proof-of-concept prototype to validate the project without requiring Ernst & Young to first commit to a large investment. Following this initial success, we then proceeded to develop the complete product.

We helped Ernst & Young refine their ideas and formulate them into a detailed and consistent functional description, translating complex tax calculations and workflows into clear documentation. This gave Ernst & Young a clear description of the planned system functionality, which Lunatech then used to construct a sophisticated but easy-to-use web application.</p>

We achieved this by being flexible enough to accommodate changing requirements without being held back by an outdated project plan, and by helping Ernst & Young to plan releases that kept up the pace rather than succumb to unnecessary feature creep.</p>
