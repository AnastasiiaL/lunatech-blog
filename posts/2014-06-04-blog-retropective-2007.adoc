2007’s blog posts were about events, one way or another. The technical
articles weren’t directly about the events, but reflect the Java EE web
development topics that became the focus of the year’s events.

== Software development

https://blog.lunatech.com/posts/2007-01-31-business-class-or-economy[Business
Class or Economy?] discusses a question raised by
http://keith.harrison-broninski.info/[Keith Harrison-Broninski] in his
JavaPolis 2006 presentation. I like this article because it explores a
rarely-discussed question about commercial software development
projects: when is more expensive better than cheap? After all, software
developers are constantly in danger of optimising the wrong thing at the
wrong time.

== JavaServer Faces and JBoss Seam

At the end of 2006 it was clear that we were way overdue for an
alternative to Struts 1.x for our next Java web project, so we set out
to choose an alternative, from the things we had heard about or tried
out on internal experimental projects. One Friday, we formed several
teams of two people and tried implementing a simple web-based expense
claim form, each with a different web framework.

for the expense form assignment]]

The candidates for our next web framework, chosen on various whims,
were: JSF/JBoss Seam, Wicket, Tapestry, GWT/EJB3 and UCW/Common Lisp
(don’t ask). No-one chose the likely candidates: Spring MVC, Ruby on
Rails, Webwork or something with Perl or Python. In the end, for various
reasons, we chose JSF with JBoss Seam as the next framework to use on a
serious project.

https://blog.lunatech.com/posts/2007-06-13-jsf-facelets-custom-date-converter[JSF-Facelets
custom date converter] was an early example of one of the things that we
liked about Seam 1.2. Despite some complexity, you could customise the
framework by providing alternative implementations of built-in
components that would be easily reusable on other projects.

https://blog.lunatech.com/posts/2007-11-07-changing-credentials-without-logging-again-seam-121[Changing
credentials without logging in again in Seam 1.2.1] was an example of
the other side of the coin: some things turned out to be difficult, but
possible once you looked at the source code and worked out which built
in component to replace.

== Events

Following various conversations and beers with JBoss developers at
JavaPolis 2006, we decided to take Tom Baeyens up on his suggestion to
create a JBoss User Group (JBUG) and host some developer events in
Rotterdam.

Benelux User Group, 8 June 2007] was the first JBUG event in Rotterdam,
at which Tom Baeyens from JBoss spoke about business process management
and Lunatech’s Peter Kaas spoke about EJB. As the

I talked about our experiences so far with Seam.
