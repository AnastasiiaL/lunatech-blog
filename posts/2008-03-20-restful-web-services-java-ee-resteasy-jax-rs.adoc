== Introduction

Suppose we have a web application, where one can access and edit
catalogues or inventory. We have a nice web site with lots of pages and
nice user interface, wizards and all the web 2.0 buzzwords (ever notice
how that attracts buzzards?). The web site is very useful for people and
they find it nice.

Now since we are talking about catalogues and inventory, we want our web
site to be useful for companies doing inventory management. They have a
different expectation: integration. They want their existing system's
data to be loaded (and managed) automatically from their existing system
into our web site, which was designed for real people rather than remote
programs.

At this point we have to start thinking about how to allow remote
programmatic access to our web site's back-end, where we store our
catalogue and inventory data. We store this data in a database, but we
don't want to allow outside people access in our precious database,
where they could bypass all the security and validation that we have
built in the layers above our database in our web application.

We are using
http://java.sun.com/javaee/overview/faq/persistence.jsp[Java
persistence] to map database rows and tables to _POJOs_ (Plain Old Java
Objects using
http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/guide/language/annotations.html[Java
annotations] to describe the database mapping). These are called
http://java.sun.com/javaee/5/docs/tutorial/doc/bnbpy.html[_Entity Java
Beans_] in the _EJB 3_
(http://java.sun.com/javaee/5/docs/tutorial/doc/bnblr.html[Enterprise
Java Beans 3]) jargon.

Our two main such entities are:

* `Item`, which represents a catalogue or inventory item, and
* `Person`, which represents the owner of a catalogue, or item.

We even have a nice tier-based decoupling of our web application:

* the web interface tier, responsible for the user interface,
* the business logic tier, the middle-man between the tiers above and
below, and
* the persistence tier, which comes down to storing the data accessed
and displayed by the other tiers.

Obviously if we want to allow remote access and manipulation of data
with security and validation, the remote interface on the server side
has to have access to the persistence tier, and possibly some of the
business logic tier if validation or security resides there.

Our goal is then to provide access to our `Item` and `Person` entities
via web services.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer[RESTful]
web services are so hyped at the moment, so we will try that.

The rest of this article describes our existing architecture, the
introduction of RESTful web services within our architecture, its
effects and how we did it.

[[architecture]]
== Our existing architecture

In the introduction I mentioned the traditional tier-based organisation
of our web application. With a little bit more detail, this is how they
are implemented:

* Web interface tier: Java https://facelets.dev.java.net[Facelets]
* Business logic tier:
http://java.sun.com/javaee/5/docs/tutorial/doc/bnbly.html#bnbma[stateful
session beans] which pass along the web interface requests to the
persitence tier
* Persistence tier:
http://java.sun.com/javaee/5/docs/tutorial/doc/bnbly.html#bnbmb[stateless
session beans] (_DAO_:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_Access_Object[Data Access Objects])
which provide access to the database layer through entity beans

All of these tiers are integrated with
http://www.seamframework.org[Seam], the framework we use to ease the
implementation of each tier, and the interaction between them.

Security is usually found in the web interface tier, if only to forbid
the users from accessing functions they are not privileged to execute.
In the context of a web interface though, this is not enough because
hiding a link from a web page does not prevent a malicious user from
accessing it _by hand_ (through other tools than the website). So a
similar layer of security is traditionally found on the business logic
tier, which restricts privileged actions. Once we have been privileged
to run the business logic actions, there may or may not be another layer
of security in the persistence tier. In our case there isn't: all the
security is done in the first two tiers.

Validation is another troublesome subject: we need to make sure that the
data provided by the user (via the web site or using a web service) is
valid. The
http://java.sun.com/javaee/5/docs/api/javax/persistence/package-summary.html[Java
Persistence API] describes a number of validation annotations which can
be put on persisted properties, such as the traditional SQL (Structured
Query Language) constraints `NOT NULL` or `UNIQUE`. In fact they _only_
provide constraints which can be mapped in SQL. For higher-level
constraints, which could only be expressed in Java, we have to look
elsewhere. Our particular implementation of Java Persistence,
http://www.hibernate.org[Hibernate], provides a few more
http://www.hibernate.org/hib_docs/validator/reference/en/html_single[constraints]
as well as higher-level customisable constraints that fit our needs.

These constraints (Java Persistence or Hibernate) are only appropriate
on our entities `Item` and `Person`, but there is often validation done
in the web tier (checking that a text field contains a valid number
before trying to give it as a number to the business logic tier) or in
the business logic tier for validation which cannot be located on
entities themselves (does a given `Person` instance exist?).

The exact way to distribute the validation constraints between the three
tiers and the techniques used to do so will be the purpose of another
lengthy article of mine, so I will not go into much detail here aside
from mentioning that the only validation relevant to our needs for the
web services will be located in the persistence tier (the stateless DAO
EJBs and entities).

[[entities]]
== Our entities

Our two main entities are `Item` and `Person`.

[[person]]
=== The `Person` entity

A `Person` has:

* A unique key in a certain format
* A unique valid email address
(http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc822#section-6.1[RFC-822])
* An optional name (which is only optional if the organisation name is
not given)
* An optional organisation name (which is only optional if the name is
not given)

Here is its implementation class:

*Person.java*

[source,java=nogutter]
----
@Entity
public class Person implements Serializable {

  //
  // Persisted property fields

  @Id
  @GeneratedValue
  private long id;

  @Column(unique = true)
  @Pattern(regex = "^[A-Z][A-Z0-9]+$")
  private String key;

  @Column(unique = true)
  @NonLocalEmailAddress
  private String emailAddress;

  // we cannot put @NotEmpty here since it can be empty if organisationName is not empty
  private String name;

  // we cannot put @NotEmpty here since it can be empty if name is not empty
  private String organisationName;

  //
  // Validation methods

  @AssertTrue
  private boolean isValid(){
    // this is simplistic but good enough for an example
    if(name != null && name.trim().length() > 0)
      return true;
    return (organisationName != null && organisationName.trim().length() > 0);
  }

  //
  // Persisted properties methods (getters and setters)

  [...]
}
----

All the annotations here come either from Java Persistence or Hibernate,
except the `@NonLocalEmailAddress` annotation which is our own Hibernate
validator annotation. This annotation is linked to a custom validator
which will be invoked by Hibernate when validating the contents of the
annotated property. It will in our case check that the `emailAddress`
property is a valid non-local email address according to RFC-822.

[[item]]
=== The `Item` entity

An `Item` has:

* A non-empty name
* An optional description
* A catalogue owner
* A reference (unique by owner)
* A generated key (combining the owner key and the reference)

*Item.java*

[source,java=nogutter]
----
@Entity
@Table(uniqueConstraints = { @UniqueConstraint(columnNames = { "reference", "owner" }) })
public class Item implements Serializable {

  //
  // Persisted property fields

  @Id
  @GeneratedValue
  private long id;

  private String description;

  @Column(nullable = true)
  @ManyToOne
  private Item owner;

  private String reference;

  //
  // Persisted properties methods (getters and setters)

  [...]

  //
  // Transient properties methods

  public String getKey(){
    return owner.getKey() + '-' + reference;
  }

}
----

[[dao]]
=== Our DAOs

Our DAOs will not check for validation in this case, because it is
handled by the persistence layer. Should we try to persist an invalid
entity, the persistence layer will throw an exception and the
transaction will be rolled-back.

Here are the interfaces (their implementations do not matter much) for
`Person`:

*PersonDAO.java*

[source,java=nogutter]
----
@Local
public interface PersonDAO {
  public Person findByKey(String key);
}
----

*PersonDAOBean.java*

[source,java=nogutter]
----
@Name("personDAO")
@Stateless
public class PersonDAOBean implements PersonDAO {
  [...]
}
----

And for `Item`:

*ItemDAO.java*

[source,java=nogutter]
----
@Local
public interface ItemDAO {
  public Item findByKey(String key);
  public Set<String> findItemKeys(Person catalogueOwner);
  public void merge(Item oldItem);
  public void persist(Item newItem);
}
----

*ItemDAOBean.java*

[source,java=nogutter]
----
@Name("itemDAO")
@Stateless
public class ItemDAOBean implements ItemDAO {
  [...]
}
----

[[framework]]
== Choosing our RESTful framework

In Java, the http://jsr311.dev.java.net[JSR-311 (JAX-RS)] seems to be
the way to go to start developing RESTful web services. While the JSR is
not finished yet, it provides support for POJO RESTful web services
using annotations.

Its reference implementation, http://jersey.dev.java.net[Jersey], was
not chosen because we had trouble integrating it well with EJB3 and
Seam.

We are using the http://www.jboss.org/resteasy[RESTEasy] implementation
of JAX-RS, because we had no trouble integrating it with our EJBs and
Seam. It also has sufficient documentation.

There is another implementation from
http://cwiki.apache.org/CXF20DOC/jax-rs-jsr-311.html[Apache], but I
haven't tried it because it uses an older version of JAX-RS.

Finally there is yet another framework for RESTful web services for Java
called http://www.restlet.org[Restlet] but we did not favour it because
at the time of this writing, it is using a custom architecture, even
though proper JAX-RS support is http://stephankoo.wordpress.com/[in the
works].

[[terminology]]
== Terminology and architecture

RESTEasy can scan your JAR file for classes annotated with the
https://jsr311.dev.java.net/nonav/releases/0.6/javax/ws/rs/Path.html[@Path]
annotation which specify that the annotated class is a RESTful resource
handler.

It can also use JNDI lookups to register EJBs as resource handlers. This
is more useful for us since it allows us to use Seam components with
injection and transactions, which is why we are using this alternative.
Our two resource EJBs will be `RESTItem` and `RESTPerson`.

We are using JAXB to serialise and unserialise persistent entities
to/from XML. Basically we annotate our persistent entities with the few
JAXB annotations required to describe the XML structure. If we want to
separate the XML into several resources, we use XML IDs to map
persistent IDs to XML pointers. In order to do this we need to specify
our own JAXB _provider_ to JAX-RS, which is a class in control of how
JAXB-annotated classes will be serialised and deserialised. Our JAXB
provider will be `JAXBProvider`.

This JAXB provider has to be registered within RESTEasy. Once registered
we will use a custom IDResolver class of our own making to allow
unresolved XML IDs (which are not in the XML document sent to us by the
user) to be loaded from the persistence layer. Our custom IDResolver
will be `EntityIDResolver`.

[[deploy]]
== Deploying RESTEasy under JBoss AS

We decided to download the latest version of RESTEasy as of this
writing, which is 1.0-beta7

Once you have downloaded it, add at least the following jars to your
project:

* jaxrs-api-1.0-beta-7.jar
* resteasy-jaxrs-1.0-beta-7.jar
* scannotation-1.0.2.jar
* slf4j-api-1.5.2.jar

You have to include these files in your EAR's `lib/` folder because we
are not using their web application setup.

Next, configure your `web.xml` to start the RESTful servlet which maps
your RESTful resources under the prefix `/rest/`:

*web.xml*

[[changes]]
== Changes in the persistence entities

In order to be able to serialise and deserialise our entities using
JAXB, we only need to add a few annotations on our entities:

* http://java.sun.com/javaee/5/docs/api/javax/xml/bind/annotation/XmlRootElement.html[@XmlRootElement]
on our entity classes
* http://java.sun.com/javaee/5/docs/api/javax/xml/bind/annotation/XmlAccessorType.html[@XmlAccessorType](http://java.sun.com/javaee/5/docs/api/javax/xml/bind/annotation/XmlAccessType.html[XmlAccessType.NONE])
on our entity classes, in order for JAXB to only consider explicitely
annotated members for serialisation
* http://java.sun.com/javaee/5/docs/api/javax/xml/bind/annotation/XmlElement.html[@XmlElement]
on any property we want to serialise
* http://java.sun.com/javaee/5/docs/api/javax/xml/bind/annotation/XmlID.html[@XmlID]
on a property used as a foreign key
* http://java.sun.com/javaee/5/docs/api/javax/xml/bind/annotation/XmlIDREF.html[@XmlIDREF]
on a property which should be serialised as a pointer (foreign key)
rather than by serialising its content

Here is our JAXB-annotated `Person`:

*Person.java*

[source,java=nogutter]
----
@Entity
@XmlRootElement
@XmlAccessorType(XmlAccessType.NONE)
public class Person implements Serializable {

  //
  // Persisted property fields

  @Id
  @GeneratedValue
  private long id;

  @Column(unique = true)
  @Pattern(regex = "^[A-Z][A-Z0-9]+$")
  @XmlID
  @XmlElement
  private String key;

  @Column(unique = true)
  @NonLocalEmailAddress
  @XmlElement
  private String emailAddress;

  // we cannot put @NotEmpty here since it can be empty if organisationName is not empty
  @XmlElement
  private String name;

  // we cannot put @NotEmpty here since it can be empty if name is not empty
  @XmlElement
  private String organisationName;

  [...]
}
----

And for our `Item` entity:

*Item.java*

[source,java=nogutter]
----
@Entity
@Table(uniqueConstraints = { @UniqueConstraint(columnNames = { "reference", "owner" }) })
@XmlRootElement
@XmlAccessorType(XmlAccessType.NONE)
public class Item implements Serializable {

  //
  // Persisted property fields

  @Id
  @GeneratedValue
  private long id;

  @XmlElement
  private String description;

  @Column(nullable = true)
  @ManyToOne
  @XmlIDREF
  @XmlElement
  private Item owner;

  @XmlElement
  private String reference;

  //
  // Transient properties methods

  @XmlID
  @XmlElement
  public String getKey(){
    return owner.getKey() + '-' + reference;
  }

  [...]

}
----

We can now serialise and deserialise our entities to/from XML using
JAXB.

[[provider]]
== Our JAXB provider

In JAX-RS we can register an object responsible for reading/writing to a
given MIME type. In our case we want to be able to serialise/deserialise
any JAXB-annotated object to XML using the `application/xml` MIME type
but also all subformats of XML using the `application/*+xml` wildcard.
In order to do that we define the following provider:

*JAXBProvider.java*

[source,java=nogutter]
----
@Provider
@Consumes( { "application/xml", "application/*+xml" })
@Produces( { "application/xml", "application/*+xml" })
public class JAXBProvider implements MessageBodyReader<Object>,
  MessageBodyWriter<Object> {

  public boolean isReadable(Class<?> type, Type genericType, Annotation[] annotations,
                         MediaType mediaType) {
    return type.isAnnotationPresent(XmlRootElement.class);
  }

  public Object readFrom(Class<Object> type, Type genericType,
                         Annotation[] annotations,
                         MediaType mediaType,
                         MultivaluedMap<String, String> httpHeaders,
                         InputStream entityStream)
   throws IOException {
    try {
      JAXBContext jaxb = JAXBContext.newInstance(type);
      Unmarshaller unmarshaller = jaxb.createUnmarshaller();
      // set our own IDResolver because we want to resolve our XML IDs from the database

      unmarshaller.setProperty(IDResolver.class.getName(), new EntityIDResolver());
      Object obj = unmarshaller.unmarshal(entityStream);

      if (obj instanceof JAXBElement)
        obj = ((JAXBElement<?>) obj).getValue();
      if (!type.isInstance(obj))
        throw new WebApplicationException(HttpURLConnection.HTTP_BAD_REQUEST);
      return obj;
    }
    catch (WebApplicationException e) {
      throw e;
    }
    catch (Throwable e) {
      throw new WebApplicationException(e);
    }
  }

  public long getSize(Object arg0) {
    return -1;
  }

  public boolean isWriteable(Class<?> type, Type genericType,
                             Annotation[] annotations, MediaType mediaType) {
    return type.isAnnotationPresent(XmlRootElement.class);
  }

  /**
   * Marshalls any JAXB object to XML.
   */
  public void writeTo(Object object, Class<?> type, Type genericType,
                      Annotation[] annotations, MediaType mediaType,
                      MultivaluedMap<String, Object> httpHeaders,
                      OutputStream entityStream)
   throws IOException {
    try {
      JAXBContext jaxb = JAXBContext.newInstance(object.getClass());
      Marshaller marshaller = jaxb.createMarshaller();
      marshaller.marshal(object, entityStream);
    }
    catch (Exception e) {
      throw new WebApplicationException(e);
    }
  }

}
----

You will have noticed the use of JAX-RS
https://jsr311.dev.java.net/nonav/releases/0.6/javax/ws/rs/WebApplicationException.html[WebApplicationException]
to wrap internal exceptions, and sometimes set the HTTP response code.
This exception will be caught by our JAX-RS provider (RESTEasy) and used
to construct the HTTP response. It is also possible to specify more
elements of the response by building a
https://jsr311.dev.java.net/nonav/releases/0.6/javax/ws/rs/core/Response.html[Response]
object and passing it as parameter to the `WebApplicationException`.

In order to be able to resolve XML IDs from our database, here is our
implementation of `EntityIDResolver`:

*EntityIDResolver.java*

[source,java=nogutter]
----
public class EntityIDResolver extends IDResolver {
  @Override
  public void bind(final String id, final Object value) throws SAXException {}

  @SuppressWarnings("unchecked")
  @Override
  public Callable<?> resolve(final String id, final Class type) throws SAXException {
    return new Callable<Object>() {
      @SuppressWarnings("unchecked")
      public Object call() throws Exception {
        if (type == Person.class) {
          // use some uninteresting JNDI lookup to get our EJB DAOs
          PersonDAO personDAO = lookupEJB(PersonDAOBean.class);
          Person person = personDAO.findByKey(id);
          if (person != null)
            return person;
          throw
            new SAXException(new WebApplicationException(HttpURLConnection.HTTP_NOT_FOUND));
        }
        if (type == Item.class) {
          // use some uninteresting JNDI lookup to get our EJB DAOs
          ItemDAO itemDAO = lookupEJB(ItemDAOBean.class);
          Item item = itemDAO.findByKey(id);
          if (item != null)
            return item;
          throw
            new SAXException(new WebApplicationException(HttpURLConnection.HTTP_NOT_FOUND));
        }
        return null;
      }
    };
  }

}
----

Once again in this code we use `WebApplicationException` to specify the
response HTTP status, even though we wrap it in `SAXException` so that
the JAXB stack will unwrap it.

[[resource]]
== Our REST item resource

Now we can get to the real JAX-RS web services.

Since we are using Seam EJB components as resources, we need to split
the resource into implementation bean and interface. This allows us to
put all the JAX-RS annotations on the interface and keep our
implementation bean clean and lighter.

[[interface]]
=== The RESTItem resource interface

*RESTItem.java*

[source,java=nogutter]
----
@Local
// This declares the global path mapping of these resources
@Path("/items")
// This declares that we produce both JAXB entities, and plain text error messages
@Produces( { "application/xml", "text/plain" })
public interface RESTItem {

 /**
  * Gets a list of all the Item entities, with the optional "creator" query parameter.
  * @param creatorKey optional query parameter used to filter the returned Item entities.
  */
 // this defines a mapping for the GET HTTP method
 @GET
 // the @QueryParam annotation will cause the value of the "creator" HTTP query parameter
 // to be injected into our method argument
 public ItemList getItems(@QueryParam("creator") String creatorKey);

 /**
  * Posts a new Item object
  * @param newItem the new Item object to persist
  * @param uriInfo an object used to determine the location of the new Item resource.
  */
 // this defines a mapping for the POST HTTP method
 @POST
 // the @Context annotation will cause the method argument to be provided
 // by the JAX-RS container
 public Response postItem(Item newItem, @Context UriInfo uriInfo);

 /**
  * Gets an Item object
  * @param key the XML ID of the object to retreive
  */
 // this defines an additional path parameter to the global prefix
 @Path("{key}")
 @GET
 // the @PathParam annotation will cause the value of the "key" HTTP path parameter
 // to be injected into our method argument
 public Item getItem(@PathParam("key") String key);

 /**
  * Updates an Item object
  * @param key the XML ID of the object to update
  * @param newItem the new Item object to update
  * @param uriInfo an object used to determine the location of the new Item resource.
  */
 @Path("{key}")
 @PUT
 public void putItem(@PathParam("key") String key, Item newItem,
                     @Context UriInfo uriInfo);

}
----

We use the `Response` return value for POST in order to specify the HTTP
`Location` header for the newly created `Item`, as well as the 201
(Created) HTTP status code.

[[mapping]]
=== The RESTful API mapping

Our annotated `RESTItem` class will map the following URLs to the
following results:

[cols=",,,",]
|===
|Method |URL |mime type |result
|GET |/rest/items |application/xml |Retreives a list of Item XML IDs
|POST |/rest/items |application/xml |Creates a new Item object
|GET |/rest/items/\{key} |application/xml |Retrieves an Item instance
|PUT |/rest/items/\{key} |application/xml |Updates an Item instance
|===

[[implementation]]
=== The RESTItem implementation

*RESTItemBean.java*

=== Handling validation errors

As you have no doubt observed, there is no attempt at validation for
entities we receive and store. This is done entirely using the
annotations in our entities when the persistence layer will attempt to
merge or persist them. In the case of validation error, an exception
will be thrown by the DAO, which we catch and handle in the
`processValidationError` method:

*Validation error processing*

[source,java=nogutter]
----
public WebApplicationException processValidationError(Throwable x) {
  Throwable cause = x;
  // We need to do some unwrapping of exception first

  while (cause != null) {
    if (cause instanceof WebApplicationException)
      return (WebApplicationException) cause;
    if (cause instanceof InvalidStateException)
      break;
    if (cause instanceof BatchUpdateException)
      cause = ((SQLException) cause).getNextException();
    else
      cause = cause.getCause();
  }

  // This is a Persistence exception with information
  if (cause instanceof InvalidStateException) {
    InvalidStateException e = (InvalidStateException) cause;
    StringBuilder stringBuilder = new StringBuilder();
    // Construct a "readable" message outlining the validation errors

    for (InvalidValue invalidValue : e.getInvalidValues())
      stringBuilder.append(invalidValue.getPropertyName()).append(": ")
                   .append(invalidValue.getMessage()).append("n");

    return
      new WebApplicationException(Response.status(HttpURLConnection.HTTP_BAD_REQUEST)
                                            .entity(stringBuilder.toString()).build());
  }
  return new WebApplicationException(x, HttpURLConnection.HTTP_INTERNAL_ERROR);
}

[[conclusion]]
== Final thoughts and conclusion

The `RESTPerson` features nothing new compared to `RESTItem` and is
therefore left as an exercise for the reader.

Hibernate validation constraints can be localised, not the EJB ones, but
Hibernate provides similar validation constraints to EJB with proper
localisation.

Handling errors and providing meaningful HTTP responses is not easy, and
in our real code I have favoured using the `Response` object as a return
type for every RESTful method, for consistency, and because we had
strict specifications that forced us to include a blurb of text on top
of success responses as well as error responses.

There were a few bugs we had to fix in RESTEasy by hand throughout our
exercise, but that was alright because they provide their sources, and
they're fairly small and compact, so we can't complain.

We have finished our first version of our RESTful web services for
http://www.visiblelogistics.com[VisibleLogistics] using the techniques
outlined in this article, so you can expect to see them put to some
public test shortly.

Always on the bleeding edge.
