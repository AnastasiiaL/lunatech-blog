"Join us for the first Play!ground in the Netherlands. We love the Play
framework so much that we decided it was time to organise an event to
share our passion." ---

This is also the perfect opportunity to discover Play with Java and
Scala or to ask more about Playâ€™s advanced features. But most of all, a
Play!ground is a fun event, so expect to enjoy yourself as well!

The programme will begin with a presentation of the Play framework by
Nicolas Leroux and Peter Hilton. Nicolas Leroux and Peter Hilton work
for Lunatech and also happen to be contributors to the Play framework
open-source project. The presentation will start with a quick
introduction to Play and demonstrate a real practical example showing
more advanced features. Peter and Nicolas will also discuss the business
benefits of using the framework.

In the second presentation, Erik Bakker, another developer at Lunatech,
will talk about using Scala with Play: how to get started with Play
Scala and why you should keep an eye on this emerging technology.

In the third presentation, Arne van den Ing from Connexys will present
how they are applying Play framework to their current project. What are
the main differences in developing with Play framework and what are the
real benefits of the framework? This will be a more practical
presentation.

Of course, beer and networking are also part of the programme ;)

*The Play!ground reached his maximum capacity. We'll make sure to
organise another one pretty soon. Stay tuned!*
