Typesafe provides a variety of training courses on Typesafe stack
technologies, together with Typesafe partners in different countries.
The http://typesafe.com/training/fasttracktoplaywithscala[Fast Track To
Play With Scala] course has previously been given in San Francisco, New
York, London and Zurich. This year, we’re adding Rotterdam to the list.

== Play training at Lunatech

This year, Lunatech has become a Typesafe training partner and will
provide Typesafe’s Play framework training course. The first course is
at our Rotterdam office at the end of May.

This is a two-day course that teaches the practical skills you need to
build a web application with Play and Scala. The course is an excellent
way to get up to speed with Play for your next project and is also an
opportunity to learn to apply basic Scala programming skills.

If you want to train several developers in your organisation, we can
also provide this course on-site in your office, on-request. Please
contact us for details.

== Win a place on the course

Next week, Lunatech is going to give away a place on the 30-31 May Play
framework training course. The training course place will be the prize
in a contest at next Tuesday’s http://010dev.nl[010DEV] event.

The http://010dev.nl/post/social-tech-event-typesafe-night-010dev[010DEV
Typesafe Night] event includes a Play framework presentation by James
Ward (Typesafe) and Nicolas Leroux (Lunatech), as well as an Akka
presentation by Akka tech lead Roland Kuhn (Typesafe).

There is only one training course place to give away, but the runner-up
prize is of course free beer for everyone else who attends.
