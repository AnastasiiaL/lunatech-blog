:tags: [event]

Although I generally avoid Amsterdam, I will be making an
exception tomorrow to go to http://blog.interface21.com/main/2007/08/02/amsterdam-java-meetup-q307-september-21st/[The 7th Amsterdam Java
Meetup]
with http://sam.brodkin.com/[Sam]. It should be a good chance to meet
some more Java developers who work in the Netherlands, and although http://hilton.org.uk/amsterdam.phtml#de-jaren[De
Jaren] is hardly my
favourite cafe-bar, at least it is big enough for the expected large
crowd.
