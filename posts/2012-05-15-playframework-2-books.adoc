:title: Play framework 2 books
:tags: [playframework,books]

For the last six months we’ve been
working on a not-so-secret project to write http://www.lunatech-research.com/books[books about Play
2]. Ideally, one book about the
http://www.playframework.org/[Play framework] would have been enough,
but these days there isn’t just Java: now there’s Scala as well, which
is why we are happy to announce both *Play for Scala* and *Play for
Java*.

[[meap]]
== MEAP release

Both books are one-third complete, and now available for purchase
on-line via the Manning Early Access Program (MEAP):

* http://bit.ly/playscala[Play for Scala] by Peter Hilton, Erik Bakker
and Francisco Canedo
* http://bit.ly/playjava[Play for Java] by Nicolas Leroux and Sietse de
Kaper

The early access edition gives you four chapters, plus new chapters as
they are written, the opportunity to discuss the books with the authors
on Manning’s Author Online forum, and the final book when it is
published.

[[free]]
== Free chapters

The first chapter of each book is currently available on-line for free:

* http://bit.ly/playscala[Play for Scala] chapter 1 - Introduction to
Play 2
* http://bit.ly/playjava[Play for Java] chapter 1 - Getting started

[[scala]]
== Play for Scala

_Play for Scala_ defines Play as the easiest and default way to build
web applications with Scala. The book gets you started with Play and
then focuses on how to apply standard web application development
techniques, which will be familiar to developers who have built web
applications with another platform, using Play and Scala. The third part
of the book will cover more advanced topics. The content and code
examples are Scala only and assume basic Scala knowledge, rather than
reproducing or reinventing existing high-quality tutorials such as
http://twitter.github.com/scala_school/[Scala School]. Scala beginners
won’t have any problems keeping up.

Readers need this book because despite the rising popularity of Scala as
a post-Java language that runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), none
of the existing web frameworks have captured the attention of mainstream
web developers. Play has achieved this for Java web developers in the
two years since Play 1.0’s October 2009 release, and added Scala support
with Play 1.1’s November 2010 release. Scala support is fully-integrated
in Play 2.0, putting it on equal footing with Java, making Play a true
Scala web application development framework.

[[java]]
== Play for Java

_Play for Java_ is the book for people who want to start developing web
applications using the Play and Java, whether they are new to Java web
development or have a Java EE background. The book assumes basic
knowledge of the Java language. This book explains that web development
does not need to be complex: simplicity is at the core of Play. The book
will explain all aspects of the Play framework, and can serve as a
complete tutorial as well as a reference. It will also address Java EE
developer concerns, demonstrate how a stateless web application can fit
in an enterprise environment, and show the productivity bonuses one can
get from using Play.

The book’s running example introduces the reader to the philosophy
behind Play, and how to apply it in practice. Some of the patterns and
concepts found in a Play application will be contrasted with examples
found in Java EE applications, to ease the reader's mind shift to a
stateless way of thinking about web applications. Throughout the book,
discussion of Scala code will be kept to a minimum, since you don't have
to learn Scala to use Play.

[[why]]
== Who publishes books these days anyway?

Technical book publishing isn't dead just yet, but a few things have
changed in the last ten years. There are now more ways to share
information, this hasn’t killed off any of the media completely, any
more than video made cinema redundant, or ‘moving pictures’ stopped
everyone listening to the radio. What we do have is more choices.

The important thing about different media is that you present
information differently, instead of just translating content directly to
another format. We have already learned a lot from the team at Manning
about what we can do in a book and how it's different to blog posts and
on-line documentation.

Nobody _only_ publishes books these days, and we're not just writing
books about Play. We also publish code, present at conferences, host
informal developer events, and post on-line. This worked pretty well for
Play 1.x, which went from first release to mainstream web framework in
two years. Things are moving faster with Play 2, and we decided to write
books to help accelerate adoption.

We have several goals for the books, which are all part of helping smart
software developers to get things done:

* share our Play expertise - we don't have time to build all of the web
applications the world needs
* bring Play to a wider audience - some programmers just prefer books,
and they need Play too
* keep the books less than 2 cm thick - we don't like books with
gratuitous padding and a lack of focus
* avoid writing books for idiots - these are books for smart but busy
programmers.
