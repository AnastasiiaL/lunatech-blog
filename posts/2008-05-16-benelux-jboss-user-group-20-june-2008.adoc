We would like to invite you to our fourth Benelux JBoss User
Group meeting: an afternoon of free technical sessions presented by
JBoss developers.

The JBoss User Group is growing and even our last location is now too
small, so once again we arranged something special: we will meet in the

Zaal] in Rotterdam. http://www.i-portal.nl/[i-Portal Rotterdam] has
kindly agreed to sponsor the event by providing us with a sumptuous
room.

*Programme*

*The programme will begin* with a complete presentation of JBoss Portal.
Julien Viet, founder and lead developer, will introduce JBoss Portal,
and together with Thomas Heute, core developer, will dive into the
specifics of JBoss Portal and introduce the latest developments . *In
the second presentation*, Emmanuel Bernard, lead for Hibernate Search
and Hibernate Validation, core developer of Hibernate , will show us how
easy it is to integrate Hibernate Search in our project. *In the third
presentation*, Clara Ko and Linda van der Pal, jduchess.org founders,
will tell us all about women in I.T. Why are most of the people working
as software engineers female? Why are men not attracted to a career as
software engineers? We are testing if you are following the program, of
course :) *In the fourth* and last presentation, Kris Verlaenen, will
introduce and show us the JBoss rules engine: Drools. He will guide us
on how and when to use a rules engine, and tell us about the specifics
of JBoss Drools. In case you get thirsty, there will be an open bar
where you will get the chance to talk with the speakers around a nice
glass of wine or a cold beer. The jBPM team - Tom Baeyens and Koen Aers
- will be present as well, so that might be your chance to talk with
them. Please

as possible as we have a limited number of seats.
