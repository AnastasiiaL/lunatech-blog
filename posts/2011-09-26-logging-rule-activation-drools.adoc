== Problem

One of the reasons that you want to
http://blog.lunatech.com/2011/09/02/logging-debug-drools[log debug
messages] from your rules is that you just want to see which rules are
activated, how many times and in which order. This is frequently part of
debugging a set of rules and part of understanding how a particular rule
set works: you may need to see which rules were activated in order to
understand final results, or you may wish to know whether a particular
rule did or did not fire. However, adding a log statement to every
rule’s right-hand side takes time and clutters the code.

== Solution

Write an event listener that logs the activation of each rule, using a
lower logging level so you can disable this logging independently of
normal debug logging.

`org.drools.event.rule.AgendaEventListener` defines an interface for an
event lister that handles events relating to the ‘agenda’ - the table of
rule activations that will be ‘fired’. In this case, we are interested
in the ‘before activation fired’ event, which occurs just before an
activation’s rule’s right-hand side is executed.

The `org.drools.event.rule.DefaultAgendaEventListener` class implements
this interface with empty methods so that you only have to override the
methods that you are interested in, as in the following sub-class.

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false]
----
package com.lunatech.drools;

import org.apache.log4j.Logger;
import org.drools.definition.rule.Rule;
import org.drools.event.rule.BeforeActivationFiredEvent;
import org.drools.event.rule.DefaultAgendaEventListener;

public class EventListener extends DefaultAgendaEventListener {

    @Override
    public void beforeActivationFired(final BeforeActivationFiredEvent event) {
        final Rule rule = event.getActivation().getRule();
        final Logger log = Logger.getLogger(rule.getPackageName() + "." + rule.getName());
        log.trace(event.getClass().getSimpleName());
    }
}
----

To use this event listener, add it to the rules session before calling
`fireAllRules()`.

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false]
----
final StatelessKnowledgeSession session = knowledgeBase.newStatelessKnowledgeSession();
session.addEventListener(new EventListener());
----

A rules session with rules in `pricing.order` and `pricing.shipment`
packages might then generate output like the following.

[source,brush:,plain;,gutter:,false]
----
15:42:02,851 pricing.order.Order line - BeforeActivationFiredEventImpl
15:42:02,851 pricing.order.Order line - BeforeActivationFiredEventImpl
15:42:02,852 pricing.order.Order line - BeforeActivationFiredEventImpl
15:42:02,853 pricing.shipment.Basic charge - BeforeActivationFiredEventImpl
15:42:02,854 pricing.shipment.Book - BeforeActivationFiredEventImpl
15:42:02,854 pricing.shipment.Book - BeforeActivationFiredEventImpl
15:42:02,855 pricing.shipment.DVD - BeforeActivationFiredEventImpl
15:42:02,857 pricing.shipment.Express shipping - BeforeActivationFiredEventImpl
----

[[how]]
== How it works

This will generate a lot of output, in general, which is why the log
level is `TRACE`.

The Logger ‘category’ is based on the rule’s package name and rule name,
instead of the `EventListener` class itself. This means that the useful
part of the log output is the rule name, not the fixed log message: the
log output is effectively a list of executed rules.

Note that categorising log messages by package and rule name also makes
it easy to filter the logging in the Log4J configuration. You can
configure the log output to only include the subset of rules you are
interested in.
