On 14 August, 2009, the Lunatech Golf
Invitational was held at the http://www.rottebergen.nl/[Golfbaan
Rottebergen]. This year we had 25 golfers
that played in the tournament, and 20 Persons taking part in the clinic.
Not too bad considering we are in the holiday high season.

The first flight of Ron Felius and James Wang went off at 12:15. James,
who had to leave early and missed the awards ceremony thought he was
safe with his score of net 73 and 34 stableford points. But this proved
not to be the case. After the first two holes I realized that I would
never be in contention for the Cup. However I still had a very nice
afternoon playing in a flight with Patrick and Floris. Once they got
over the shock of being outside the Amsterdam Ring, they settled in and
enjoyed the beauty of the Rottebergen.

The clinic kicked off at 14:30. The enthusiasm was high, the pro's said
they had difficulty getting people to the terrace for a drink when the
clinic was over. of course, getting to the 19th hole is never a problem
for a seasoned golfer. A few of the clinic players have already said
that next year they will be playing in the golf event, this was nice to
hear.

== The prizes

While winning is not the most important thing, it is always nice to come
home with a trophy or a bottle of wine. In some cases, both. This year
we have the following winners:

Longest drive ladies - Janneke Spaan won the longest drive for the
ladies with a monster drive of 240+.

Longest drive men - Ferdinand Houwink won the longest drive for the men,
nobody else hit the fairway in regulation.

Neary - Danny Fiere won the closest to the pin, he could be heard
yelling repeatedly "here it is" while the rest of his flight was looking
for his shanked shot off to the rightâ€¦

Cup winner - Mark Hillen was the overall winner, winning both the
stableford AND strokeplay trophies. Time for a handicap correction Mark?

Other - Michael won the Silvio Ferrero trophy for most provisional tee
shots required (and played).

Driving Clinic - Eric-Paul Scholten won the driving contest, he took his
aggression out on the balls instead of customers.

Putting Clinic - Stefan Versluis won the putting clinic, as putting
counts for 40% of your golf score we expect great things of Stefan in
next years event.

== Until next year

We hope that everyone had an enjoyable day. We look forward to inviting
you all again next year. We hope that Mark will come back and defend his
Lunatech Invitational title in 2010. Next year we wil try to schedule it
earlier in the year so as not to conflict with the summer holidays.
