:title: Debugging deadlocks in JPA and PostgreSQL
:tags: [java,jpa,postgres]

In this article I describe a recent problem
I had with PostgreSQL, where a deadlock caused my application to crash
for unclear reasons. Naturally I also describe how to debug such
problems and the reason for the deadlock.

[#DebuggingdeadlocksinJPAandPostgreSQL-Ourapplication]
== Our application

We have a large transaction doing batch uploads which inserts rows of
`item_component`. Every 100 entities inserted it will flush the session
to the DB in order to save memory. That does not commit the transaction,
it just sends the SQL commands to the database.

For each item inserted we create a separate transaction which:

. reads a `person` row,
. locks it with `LockMode.UPGRADE` to prevent concurrent modification
(this is implemented with `SELECT FOR UPDATE`,
. increments a counter in one column,
. commits, thus dropping back the lock.

Because our batch insertion transaction does not need to lock the
`person` table, this _should_ work fine.

[#DebuggingdeadlocksinJPAandPostgreSQL-Findingthedeadlock]
== Finding the deadlock

Our code does not work: the first 100 items are created fine, the
`person` objects are locked and incremented 100 times, but when I flush
the first 100 inserted items to the DB (which works OK), the next
`person` lock/increment hangs forever. Deadlock.

After ruling out anything that is triggered by our JPA code (disable
Hibernate Search, entity listeners, caching), I have to conclude this
could be a database mystery.

The first step is to find out the PostgreSQL transaction IDs of my JPA
transactions. This can be done using the code
link:#DebuggingdeadlocksinJPAandPostgreSQL-tid[shown below]. Our batch
insertion has TX ID *3/1501* while our blocking lock/increment TX ID is
*2/4942*. If we list all lock and transaction information using the
query link:#DebuggingdeadlocksinJPAandPostgreSQL-query[shown below]
(after filtering out locks on indexes, views and sequences and removing
columns we do not care about) we get the following results:

[cols=",,,,,,,,,",]
|===
|# |Type |TX ID |VTX ID |Mode |G |Name |K |SQL |W

|_TX = Transaction; VTX = Virtual TX; G = Granted; K = Kind; W =

Let's first describe what each line is about:

. This is an exclusive lock on the `person` row we are locking
. The PostgreSQL manual
[.nobr]#http://www.wirebound.net/docs/8.3/static/explicit-locking.html[describes]#
this lock as being taken for `FOR UPDATE`
. The PostgreSQL manual
[.nobr]#http://www.wirebound.net/docs/8.3/static/view-pg-locks.html[explains]#
that _Every transaction holds an exclusive lock on its virtual
transaction ID for its entire duration_.
. The PostgreSQL manual
[.nobr]#http://www.wirebound.net/docs/8.3/static/view-pg-locks.html[explains]#
that _When one transaction finds it necessary to wait specifically for
another transaction, it does so by attempting to acquire share lock on
the other transaction ID_. So here we have the lock/increment *2/4941*
transaction waiting for our batch insertion transaction *3/1501* to
complete.
. Why this transaction holds this lock is beyond me. The PostgreSQL
manual
[.nobr]#http://www.wirebound.net/docs/8.3/static/explicit-locking.html[explains]#
that this lock is obtained for `SELECT FOR UPDATE|SHARE` which is never
called by this transaction, so go figure...
. This is a normal lock obtained automatically when inserting an item in
a table. The table here is `item_component`.
. This is a normal lock obtained automatically when selecting an item
from a table. This lock on `person` cannot harm and is entirely normal.
. The PostgreSQL manual
[.nobr]#http://www.wirebound.net/docs/8.3/static/view-pg-locks.html[explains]#
that _Every transaction holds an exclusive lock on its virtual
transaction ID for its entire duration_.
. The PostgreSQL manual
[.nobr]#http://www.wirebound.net/docs/8.3/static/view-pg-locks.html[explains]#
_If a permanent ID is assigned to the transaction (which normally
happens only if the transaction changes the state of the database), it
also holds an exclusive lock on its permanent transaction ID until it
ends_

[#DebuggingdeadlocksinJPAandPostgreSQL-Thediagnosis]
== The diagnosis

My lock/increment transaction is waiting for the batch insertion
transaction to release its lock on the `person` row it is trying to
lock. We now have to find out why it acquired this lock since I did not
do it manually.

[#DebuggingdeadlocksinJPAandPostgreSQL-PostgreSQLimplicitlocks]
== PostgreSQL implicit locks

After trying it myself in a PostgreSQL console, the following SQL causes
a `ROW SHARE` lock to be obtained on the `person` row referenced by
foreign key 2:

[source,code-java]
----
begin;
insert into item_component (item_component_id, creator_id) values (nextval('hibernate_sequence'), 2);
----

Of course this `ROW SHARE` lock is held until my batch insert
transaction is committed, and prevents my lock/increment transactions
from doing their job.

After a friendly chat on the PostgreSQL IRC channel I was able to get a
confirmation that this behaviour is normal and a result of the RI
(Referential Integrity) triggers. I have sent a mail to the
documentation mailing list asking for better documentation of such
implicit side-effect locks that will help others like me not waste days
finding this out.

Now I need to find a better strategy for my code.

[#DebuggingdeadlocksinJPAandPostgreSQL-DisplayVirtualTransactionIDinJPA]
 === Display Virtual Transaction ID in JPA

Use this code to find out your PostgreSQL virtual transaction ID:

[source,code-java]
----
 public Object getTXID() {
  Query query =
   entityManager.createNativeQuery("select virtualtransaction from pg_locks where pid = pg_backend_pid()");
  return query.getSingleResult();
 }

[#DebuggingdeadlocksinJPAandPostgreSQL-Listingalllocksandtheirtransactions]
==== Listing all locks and their transactions

Use this SQL to list all locks and their transactions:

[source,code-java]
----
select
 locktype, database, relation, page, tuple, transactionid, virtualtransaction, mode, granted,
 relname, relkind,
 datname, usename,
 case
  when length(current_query) > 40
    then substring(current_query for 20) || '...'
         || substring(current_query from (length(current_query) - 19) for 20)
  else current_query
 end as query,
 waiting, query_start, client_addr, client_port
from pg_locks
 left outer join pg_class on oid = relation
 left outer join pg_stat_activity on pid = procpid
order by pid;
