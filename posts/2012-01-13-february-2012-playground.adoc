Java playground playframework event author: Peter Hilton summary: "By
popular demand, we have arranged a bigger location for next month’s
February Play!ground event, for [Play
framework](http://www.playframework.org/) users, because we have had
close registration for previous events that were full. Instead of using
the Lunatech office, which limits us to thirty attendees, we have booked
a location with capacity for 150 people." ---

Almost three years ago, in February 2008, Lunatech organised a
now-legendary JBUG event at http://www.paddymurphys.nl/[Paddy Murphy’s
Irish Pub] in Rotterdam, with presentations from core JBoss developers
Pete Muir and Tom Baeyens

2008 event photos]).
