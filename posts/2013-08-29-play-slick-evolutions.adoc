:title: Using Play framework database evolutions with Slick 1.0.1  
:tags: [slick,playframework]

This tutorial for using [Slick](http://slick.typesafe.com) with a \
    [Play Framework](http://www.playframework.com) application
    shows you how to create your database and apply data model.

A Play framework web application that uses a relational database will
generally assume that the database already exists at runtime. The
database, with its tables and other objects, is an application
dependency that we expect to be set-up as part of application
installation. You automate this by providing SQL scripts that
http://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.1.x/Evolutions[Play
Evolutions] uses to create the database.

https://blog.lunatech.com/posts/2013-08-13-play-slick-scala-console[Using the
Scala console with Play and Slick] shows you how to use Slick to
generate the SQL DDL statements that create tables in your database,
which you can use to write your SQL database creation scripts. Most of
the rest is more about using Play evolutions than about Slick, but using
Slick in the right way reduces the amount of work you have to do
yourself.

== Summary

You’ll need to know how to complete the following tasks.

== Creating an initial Evolutions script

In
https://blog.lunatech.com/posts/2013-08-08-play-slick-getting-started[Getting
started with Play and Slick] we started with a simple database table
mapping:


[source,scala,linenums]
----
package models.database

import play.api.db.slick.Config.driver.simple._

class Cocktails extends Table[(Long, String)]("COCKTAIL") {
  def id = column[Long]("ID")
  def name = column[String]("NAME")
  def * = id ~ name
}
----


To use this at runtime, you need a `COCKTAIL` table with `ID` and `NAME`
columns. Normally, when using evolutions, you write an SQL data
definition language (DDL) script yourself, to create the initial
database contents.

With default settings, the first evolutions script is the file
`conf/evolutions/default/1.sql`. When evolutions are enabled, Play will
run this script when the application starts, if it hasn’t run it before.
Instead of writing it by hand, use
https://github.com/freekh/play-slick[play-slick] to generate it:

[arabic]
. follow the
https://blog.lunatech.com/2013-08-08-play-slick-getting-started[getting
started instructions] to set-up your application
. add the table mapping in `app/models/database/Cocktails.scala`
. tell Slick where the table mappings are with the following addition to
the Play configuration in `conf/application.conf`:


[source,text,linenums]
----
	slick.default="models.database.*"
----

Now run the application (in DEV mode) - Slick creates the initial script
in `conf/evolutions/default/1.sql`:


[source,sql,linenums]
----
# --- Created by Slick DDL
# To stop Slick DDL generation, remove this comment and start using Evolutions

# --- !Ups

create table "COCKTAIL" ("ID" BIGINT NOT NULL,"NAME" VARCHAR NOT NULL);

# --- !Downs

drop table "COCKTAIL";
----

After Slick creates this Script, Play will see that there is a new
Evolutions script and offer to run it:

run the evolutions script]

Now you have a database for your application to use at runtime.

=== Adding test data

The initial SQL script that Slick generates will create a database with
empty tables. In practice, your application will be more interesting if
it has some data, but the first release of an application probably
doesn’t have functionality to edit data in place yet. Especially if you
deploy to the test server after every feature so that your customer can
see continuous delivery. It can be useful to add test data at this
stage, to avoid blank pages.

To add initial data to your application, add it to your evolutions
script. Start with three classic cocktails:


[source,sql,linenums]
----
insert into COCKTAIL values (1, 'Margarita');
insert into COCKTAIL values (2, 'Caipirinha');
insert into COCKTAIL values (3, 'Piña colada');
----

In DEV mode, Play will detect the change on the next request and offer
to run the new script.

image:../media/2013-08-29-play-slick-evolutions/evolutions-test-data.png[Updated
evolutions script]

As you can see, Play will first run a `Downs` section that drops the
table. This is the `Downs` section from the previous version of the
script, which Play stored in the database. This safely reverts the
database to its state before Play ran the first version of `1.sql`,
before applying the `Ups` from the second version of the same script. As
you work on adding test data to `1.sql` you will repeat this process for
each change: modify the script, reload the page in the browser, and
apply evolutions to reapply the script.

This is is what you want during development, but once you have deployed
a production release, it is important not to change `1.sql` again. If
you do, Play will have to run the `Downs` from all of the scripts
applied so far, which is generally destructive, before applying all of
the `Ups` in the correct order. Instead, only make changes in evolution
scripts that have not been run on production yet. You can check this by
querying the `play_evolutions` table.

SQL `insert` statements are fine for small amounts of tests data. If
you’re going to import a truly huge amount of data, then you might want
something else that will be less verbose and will perform better. For
example, PostgreSQL’s `COPY` command lets you insert tab-separated data
that you provide in-line or in a separate file.

=== Using different databases for development and production

You may want to use different databases for development and
test/production, so you can use an in-memory H2 database for development
and MySQL production, for example.

This works, because https://github.com/freekh/play-slick[play-slick]
uses the Slick driver for the database specified by the current Play
configuration. This means that you can use a different Play
configuration for the production database and queries will continue to
work at runtime, because Slick generates SQL in the correct
database-specific dialect.

However, you still have hand-written SQL in your evolutions SQL scripts,
which will then have to work on both development and production
databases. This is possible, if you stick to standard SQL that both
databases support, but this is likely to be too limiting for
`create table` DDL statements, where you generally use database-specific
column types.

If you do try writing cross-database SQL scripts, you probably won’t be
able to quote table names, because the quoting characters vary:

....
create table "COCKTAILS" -- H2 uses double quotes
create table `COCKTAILS` -- MySQL uses backticks
....

In SQL, quoted table names are case-sensitive while unquoted names are
not, which is reasonable. What you might not expect is that if you’re
using H2 `create table cocktails` creates a table called `COCKTAILS`,
not `cocktails`, which makes your queries fail at runtime if you use
lower-case names in your Slick table definition:


[source,text,linenums]
----
[JdbcSQLException: Table "cocktail" not found; SQL statement: 
select x2."id", x2."name" from "cocktail" x2 [42102-168]]
----

An alternative might be to have separate evolutions SQL scripts, but
there isn’t an obvious way to do this and it’s duplication that you
probably don’t want anyway. Ideally, in the case of H2, you would just
use it’s MySQL compatibility mode in development, and use MySQL dialect
in your SQL scripts. However, this won’t work because Slick will still
generate H2 dialect SQL for queries at runtime.

For now, our conclusion is that you have to use the same database in
production and development. Fortunately - if you’re using MySQL on OSX,
say - this isn’t much harder than `brew install mysql`.

=== Applying data model changes

The first production release is straightforward: you have a single
evolutions file, generated by Slick, possibly with additional test data.
What’s harder is when your next production release includes data model
changes. You need to know how to write a second evolutions SQL script
that modifies the existing database to change it to the new data model,
without destroying existing data.

The good news is that most database platforms make it easy to modify
existing tables using SQL DDL, so you can refactor your data model by
changing table definitions. If you have a DBA who tells you that the
data model is written in stone and must not be changed, then you’re more
likely to need a new DBA than a new database platform.

Changing the table definitions is actually the easy part: preserving the
data is the tricky part. Some tricks are standard: when you add a
`NOT NULL` column, you either specify a default value or you add the
column without the constraint, set the value for all existing rows and
then add the constraint. Some issues are less obvious.

Suppose you have a database table with non-empty date columns for
recording when the record was created and updated. A good default value
for both fields is the current date and time. However, MySQL currently
only allows one date column to have a default value. This means that you
have to add an additional update statement to fix the other column’s
value.


[source,sql,linenums]
----
alter table COCKTAILS add column CREATED TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP;
alter table COCKTAILS add column UPDATED TIMESTAMP;
update COCKTAILS set UPDATED = CREATED where UPDATED = '0000-00-00 00:00:00';
----


In general, you need to do something similar for every data model
change: whenever you add or change a column, think about what the new
values for that column should be. Note that this still applies if your
data model change is to remove a column, because the `Downs` section in
the script has to revert the change by adding the column again and
somehow repopulating its contents.

=== Automatically generating create/drop scripts

To write the SQL scripts for applying data model changes, you need to
know the correct syntax for things like column types and indexes. It’s
convenient to use Slick to generate a complete `create database' script
for the current database, so that you can use its differences to the
previous version to identify which changes are needed, and what the new
syntax is.

It is also convenient to have `create database' and `drop database'
scripts if you want to create a complete database without using Play
evolutions. Running both scripts is a quick way to reset the whole
database to empty tables.

As you saw earlier, Slick only generates the initial SQL: script if you
haven’t already already created one. Instead, you can write your own
code to generate `create-database.sql` and `drop-database.sql` scripts
when the application starts in development mode. The following class is
a Play `GlobalSettings` that does just that, based on the code from the
play-slick’s `play.api.db.slick.SlickDDLPlugin` Play plug-in.


[source,scala,linenums]
----
import java.io.File
import play.api.db.slick.plugin.TableScanner
import play.api.libs.Files
import play.api.{Mode, Application, GlobalSettings}

object Global extends GlobalSettings {

  private val configKey = "slick"
  private val ScriptDirectory = "conf/evolutions/"
  private val CreateScript = "create-database.sql"
  private val DropScript = "drop-database.sql"
  private val ScriptHeader = "-- SQL DDL script\n-- Generated file - do not edit\n\n"

/**
 * Creates SQL DDL scripts on application start-up.
 */
  override def onStart(application: Application) {

	if (application.mode != Mode.Prod) {
	  application.configuration.getConfig(configKey).foreach { configuration =>
		configuration.keys.foreach { database =>
		  val databaseConfiguration = configuration.getString(database).getOrElse{
			throw configuration.reportError(database, "No config: key " + database, None)
		  }
		  val packageNames = databaseConfiguration.split(",").toSet
		  val classloader = application.classloader
		  val ddls = TableScanner.reflectAllDDLMethods(packageNames, classloader)

		  val scriptDirectory = application.getFile(ScriptDirectory + database)
		  Files.createDirectory(scriptDirectory)

		  writeScript(ddls.map(_.createStatements), scriptDirectory, CreateScript)
		  writeScript(ddls.map(_.dropStatements), scriptDirectory, DropScript)
		}
	  }
	}
  }

  /**
   * Writes the given DDL statements to a file.
   */
  private def writeScript(ddlStatements: Seq[Iterator[String]], directory: File, 
	fileName: String): Unit = {
	
	val createScript = new File(directory, fileName)
	val createSql = ddlStatements.flatten.mkString("\n\n")
	Files.writeFileIfChanged(createScript, ScriptHeader + createSql)
  }
}
----


This will create or update both scripts in the `conf/evolutions/default`
directory (if changed). Add these files to version control, even though
they are generated, so that you get SQL diffs when you make changes.

=== Next steps

Now you have created an initial database and populated it with test
data, you can:
