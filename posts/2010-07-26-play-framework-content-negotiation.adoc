:title: Play framework 1.0 content negotiation
:tags: [playframework,java]

One thing that the http://www.playframework.org/[Play
framework] 1.0 has in common with other
RESTful architectures is the direct use of HTTP functionality, instead
of trying to hide HTTP or put an abstraction layer on top of it. This
article shows you how to use HTTP content negotiation in a Play
framework web application.

[[Contentnegotiation]]
== Content negotiation

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_negotiation[Content negotiation] is
an HTTP feature that allows an HTTP server to serve different
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_media_type[media types] for the
same URL, according to which media types are requested by the HTTP
client. The client specifies acceptable content types using media types
in the `Accept` header, such as requiring an XML response with:

[source,brush:,plain;,gutter:,false]
----
 Accept: application/xml
----

A client may specify more than one media type, and also specify that any
media type is acceptable with a catch-all wild-card media type (`*/*`):

[source,brush:,plain;,gutter:,false]
----
 Accept: application/xml, image/png, */*
----

Conventional web browsers always include the wild-card value in the
`Accept` header: they will accept any media type, and Play will serve
HTML - the default 'format'. Content negotiation is more likely to be
used by custom clients, such as an Ajax request that requires a JSON
response, or an e-book reader that requires a PDF or EPUB version of a
document.

[[Playrequestformat]]
== Play request format

Play implements content negotiation by parsing the `Accept` header and
setting `request.format`, which is used to select the view template by
file extension.

The default format for a Play request is `html`, which is selected if
the `Accept` header contains `text/html` or `application/xhtml`, or as a
result of the wildcard `*/*` value. The default format is not selected
if the wildcard value is not present.

The default template for the `index()` controller method (and `html`
format) is therefore the file `index.html`. If you specify a different
format, in one of several ways, you can select an alternate template.

[[Builtinformats]]
== Built-in formats

Play has built-in support for a few formats: `html`, `txt`, `json` and
`xml`. For example, define a controller method that renders some data:

[source,java]
----
 public static void index() {
   final String name = "Peter Hilton";
   final String organisation = "Lunatech Research";
   final String url = "http://www.lunatech-research.com/";
   render(name, organisation, url);
}
----

If you request a URL that is mapped to this method
(`http://localhost:9000/` in a new Play application) in a web browser,
then play will render the `index.html` template, because web browsers
send an `Accept` header that includes the value `text/html`.

Play responds to a request with the header `Accept: text/xml` by setting
the request format to `xml` and rendering an `index.xml` template, such
as:

[source,xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<contact>
   <name>${name}</name>
   <organisation>${organisation}</organisation>
   <url>${url}</url>
</contact>
----

The built in `Accept` header format mappings work as follows, for an
`index()` controller method.

[cols=",,,",]
|===
|`Accept` header  |Format  |Template file name  |Mapping

|`null` |`null` |`index.html` |Default template extension for `null`
format

|`image/png` |`null` |`index.html` |Media type not mapped to a format

|`*/*, image/png` |`html` |`index.html` |Default media type mapped to
`html` format

|`text/html` |`html` |`index.html` |Built-in format

|`application/xhtml` |`html` |`index.html` |Built-in format

|`text/xml` |`xml` |`index.xml` |Built-in format

|`application/xml` |`xml` |`index.xml` |Built-in format

|`text/plain` |`txt` |`index.txt` |Built-in format

|`text/javascript` |`json` |`index.json` |Built-in format

|`application/json, */*` |`json` |`index.json` |Built-in format, default
media type ignored
|===

[[Customformats]]
== Custom formats

If you want to serve a response with a particular media type you can set
the format before calling the `render` method. For example, to serve a
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vcard[vCard], you can do:

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false]
----
 request.format = "vcf";
----

Instead of applying this format to all requests, you can implement
content negotiation by inspecting the request headers, so that you only
set that format when the HTTP request selects the corresponding media
type. In your controller, check for your custom format before all
requests:

[source,java]
----
 @Before
static void setFormat() {
   if (request.headers.get("accept").value().equals("text/x-vcard")) {
      request.format = "vcf";
   }
}
----

Now, a request with a `Accept: text/x-vcard` header will render an
`index.vcf` template, such as:

[source,brush:,plain;,gutter:,false]
----
 BEGIN:VCARD
VERSION:3.0
N:${name}
FN:${name}
ORG:${organisation}
URL:${url}
END:VCARD
----

Note that this also sets the response `Content-type` to `text/x-vcard`
because of the media type mapping in Play's `mime-types.properties`
file, which may allow your system to open the vCard in a suitable
application, such as Address Book on a Mac.

[[URLbasedformatspecification]]
== URL-based format specification

An alternative to using HTTP headers is to use the URL to specify the
format. This is less in the spirit of HTTP, but can be useful as a
fallback for supporting HTTP clients that cannot control the headers
they send.

You can add formats as specific routes, by specifying the format for the
controller method. With the same `index()` method as above, the
following route will handle a request for `/index.xml`, setting the
format to `xml` and rendering the `index.xml` template.

[source,brush:,plain;,gutter:,false]
----
 GET    /index.xml          Application.index(format:'xml')
----

Play can also extract the format directly from the URL, with a route
such as the following.

[source,brush:,plain;,gutter:,false]
----
 GET    /index.{format}     Application.index
----

With this route, a request for `/index.xml` will set the format to `xml`
and render the XML template, while `/index.txt` will render the plain
text template.
