:tags: [opinion]

2011 brought new things to Lunatech - widespread git use, more 
    JavaScript and functional programming, Scala, specialist front-end 
    development and, of course, a lot more Play Framework.

As well as the technical stuff, there were also new events, for that
unique combination of code, socialising, beer and (for a change) sun.

== Programming

https://blog.lunatech.com/posts/2011-03-21-functional-programming-puzzle[A
functional programming puzzle] by Stéphane discussed functional
programming in JavaScript, while Francisco turned to Scala for
https://blog.lunatech.com/posts/2011-11-25-scala-list-extractor-demystified[The
Scala List extractor demystified]. These articles are glimpses of the
shift away from Java, which Lunatech had been using almost exclusively
since migrating from Perl, 10-12 years earlier.

don’t do layout] and
https://blog.lunatech.com/posts/2011-07-11-class-struggle[Class Struggle], by
Egor Kloos, started to introduce us to front-end development, which
hadn’t been a separate specialism at Lunatech in previous years. Even
more than new programming languages, this was a brave new world indeed.

== Software development

https://blog.lunatech.com/posts/2011-02-15-software-estimation-manifesto[The
Software Estimation Manifesto] is an experimental style of blog post
that introduces a checklist for estimation - an old software development
problem. This checklist skips all of the explanation, and merely
enumerates the things that you shouldn’t forget if you want your
estimates to be any good. Estimation remains hard to this day and the
newest idea, at the time of writing, is that the only way to win is not
to play: the alternative is called

https://blog.lunatech.com/posts/2011-03-31-two-month-internship-lunatech[A two
month internship at Lunatech] returns to recruitment, with Ludovico’s
first-hand account of starting as an intern at Lunatech. This is as
close as we get to apprenticeship these days, and is a pretty good
solution to the difficulty of adequately assessing a programmer in an
interview-based approach.

https://blog.lunatech.com/posts/2011-04-11-we-have-moved-git-why-havent-you[We
have moved on to git, why haven’t you?] describes part of the technology
lifecycle we continually go through: the new thing becomes the old
thing, and we’re constantly looking out for the next new thing. First
CVS, then Subversion and then experimentation with distributed version
control systems. At a certain point, for the candidate technologies that
get this far, the experiments have created enough benefits, expertise
and evangelism to create a critical mass of people who are ready to
start using new technology on their new projects.

== Events

https://blog.lunatech.com/posts/2011-08-02-first-playground-netherlands[First
Play!ground in the Netherlands] was the first of several Play Framework
events, after we moved our focus from Java EE technologies, with largely
the same format (and attendees) as previous JBoss User Group events.

https://blog.lunatech.com/posts/2011-10-04-duse-xiv-meetup[Duse XIV at Lunatech
Research], meanwhile, was the first Scala event at Lunatech, reflecting
growing interest and experimentation and the first small-case use of
Scala on customer projects.

https://blog.lunatech.com/posts/2011-09-05-playframework-javazone-2011[Lunatech
presents Play Framework at JavaZone 2011] was another first - the first
of many international Play Framework presentations, for which Nicolas
and I travelled to Norway. JavaZone turned out to be an excellent
conference, although the local beer at the speakers’ dinner was perhaps
too good.

https://blog.lunatech.com/posts/2011-08-15-riviera-dev[Riviera DEV] was a new
RivieraJUG event in the South of France that was also the next outing
for a Play presentation, by Nicolas. See
https://blog.lunatech.com/posts/2011-10-24-lunatech-rivieradev[Lunatech at the
RivieraDEV] for the slides.
