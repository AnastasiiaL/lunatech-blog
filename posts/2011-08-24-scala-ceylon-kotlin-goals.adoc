author: Peter Hilton summary: "For various reasons, there is a lot of
discussion going on about new programming languages that run on the Java
Virtual Machine (JVM). Some of the discussion about
[Scala](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scala_(programming_language)),
[Ceylon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceylon_Project) and
[Kotlin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kotlin_(programming_language))
includes the idea that we do not need all three. After all, if you want
to use a better language than Java, one will do, right?" ---

For example, the following joke task (now pulled) on the Kotlin
project’s issue tracker suggests merging with Ceylon.

As far as I can tell, the many discussions comparing the languages
aren’t really going anywhere because language design is about tradeoffs.
These discussions also miss the point: it is more interesting to ask
what the projects’ goals are.

[[scala]]
== Scala goals

You might think that the Scala language is designed to get the largest
number of PhD students involved in the project. A more reliable source
is the
http://www.artima.com/scalazine/articles/goals_of_scala.html[interview
with Martin Odersky], inventor of Scala, in which he says:

____
The first thing we cared about was to have as clean an integration of
functional and object-oriented programming as possible.
____

The first chapter of the book
http://www.artima.com/shop/programming_in_scala[Programming in Scala]
explains this in more detail, starting with the name:

____
The name Scala stands for “scalable language.” The language is so named
because it was designed to grow with the demands of its users. You can
apply Scala to a wide range of programming tasks, from writing small
scripts to building large systems.
____

This desire for scalability is what leads to mixing object-oriented and
functional programming:

____
Technically, Scala is a blend of object-oriented and functional
programming concepts in a statically typed language. The fusion of
object-oriented and functional programming shows up in many different
aspects of Scala; it is probably more pervasive than in any other widely
used language. The two programming styles have complementary strengths
when it comes to scalability. Scala’s functional programming constructs
make it easy to build interesting things quickly from simple parts. Its
object-oriented constructs make it easy to structure larger systems and
to adapt them to new demands. The combination of both styles in Scala
makes it possible to express new kinds of programming patterns and
component abstractions. It also leads to a legible and concise
programming style.
____

The notion of concise code is the first thing that the
http://www.scala-lang.org/[Scala web site] mentions:

____
Scala is a general purpose programming language designed to express
common programming patterns in a concise, elegant, and type-safe way.
____

To summarise: Scala’s goal is to let you write a certain kind of code.

[[ceylon]]
== Ceylon goals

Compared to the Scala goals above, the goals listed in the
http://in.relation.to/Bloggers/IntroductionToCeylonPart1[Introduction to
Ceylon] are broader:

____
* to be easy to learn and understand for Java and C# developers,
* to eliminate some of Java’s verbosity, while retaining its
readability,
* to improve upon Java's typesafety,
* to provide a declarative syntax for expressing hierarchical
information like user interface definition, externalized data, and
system configuration, thereby eliminating Java's dependence upon XML,
* to support and encourage a more _“functional”_ style of programming
with immutable objects and higher-order functions,
* to provide great support for meta-programming, thus making it easier
to write frameworks, and
* to provide built-in modularity.
____

You might think that this is a bit like saying that the goal of Ceylon
is to make it easier to write Hibernate. The grain of truth in this is
that Ceylon goals are clearly a result of experience with how Java has
been used over the last ten years, which differs greatly from its
original design.

Summary: Ceylon’s goal is to design the language that Java would have
been if its designers had been able to predict the future.

[[kotlin]]
== Kotlin goals

The http://confluence.jetbrains.net/display/Kotlin/Welcome[Kotlin
documentation page] also includes a list of design goals:

____
* to create a *Java-compatible* language,
* that *compiles* at least *as fast as Java*,
* make it *safer* than Java, i.e. statically check for common pitfalls
such as null pointer dereference,
* make it *more concise* than Java by supporting variable type
inference, higher-order functions (closures), extension functions,
mixins and first-class delegation, etc;
* and, keeping the useful level of expressiveness (see above), make it
way *simpler* than the most mature competitor – *Scala*.
____

Since Kotlin comes from JetBrains, you might think that this all has
something to do with IntelliJ IDEA, their IDE. According to their own
explanation of
http://blog.jetbrains.com/kotlin/2011/08/why-jetbrains-needs-kotlin/[Why
JetBrains needs Kotlin], you’re not wrong:

____
Although we’ve developed support for several JVM-targeted programming
languages, we are still writing all of our IntelliJ-based IDEs almost
entirely in Java. We want to become more productive by switching to a
more expressive language.
____

In other words, the goal of Kotlin is to make it easier to write
IntelliJ IDEA. Of course, while you’re at it, it’s worth trying to get
the rest of the world to use the language so they also buy JetBrains’
tools. In other words:

____
The next thing is also fairly straightforward: we expect Kotlin to drive
the sales of IntelliJ IDEA.
____

Summary: the goal of Kotlin is to let us all carry on doing what we were
already doing, but with more productivity and better tools.

== Conclusion

Despite obvious differences, all three projects seem to agree on several
things; code should:

* run on the JVM
* be type safe
* be more concise than Java.

The first difference is that only Scala and Ceylon list introducing
functional programming as a project goal. At least, that is the
impression you get from a first glance at the goals lists. However, this
is merely a difference in emphasis, instead of an actual difference in
what we can expect from the languages. Dmitry Jemerov from the Kotlin
team http://twitter.com/#!/intelliyole/status/106337531699802112[wrote
in] to say that functional programming (FP) is 'more of a "duh" than an
explicit goal - so obvious for us that FP support is needed’. This is
somewhat unexpected: we seem to have progressed from a period in which
it went without saying that new languages be object-oriented to a time
when it is ‘obvious’ that new languages integrated object-oriented and
functional programming styles.

The second difference is that only Ceylon and Kotlin want to be simpler
and easier to learn than Scala. Despite the fact that Scala seems to be
an easy target for being ‘too hard’, this is actually a rather subtle
point. Scala’s designers sincerely believe that Scala is as simple and
easy to learn as it is possible for it to be, and are committed to
keeping the language as simple as possible. The crucial point is that
Scala subscribes both to the notions ‘as simple as possible’ and ‘no
simpler than that’.

In the eyes of its designers, Scala cannot be any simpler than it
already is, and it is this that the Ceylon and Kotlin projects seem to
disagree with. In other words, all three projects seem to agree that a
language should be as simple as possible, but both the Ceylon and Kotlin
projects believe that it is possible to be more simple than the Scala
project does.

Only time will tell whether Ceylon and Kotlin actually manage to be
simpler or easier to learn than Scala when they are ‘finished’, and
whether they will have become less useful than Scala in the process.
