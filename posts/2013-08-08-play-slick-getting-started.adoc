When you start building a new Play Scala web application, you probably
need to choose a database platform and a data access library to go with
it. You also need to work out how to integrate that with your Play
application.

The newest option, at the time of writing, is to use Slick to access an
SQL database. The
http://slick.typesafe.com/doc/1.0.1/gettingstarted.html[Slick 1.0.1
getting started documentation] is straightforward. However, the Slick
documentation example shows database-specific imports, a JDBC URL in the
Scala code and a Slick `threadLocalSession`.

In a Play application, you probably want to specify the database and its
URL in the Play configuration, and get a database connection from
`play.api.db.DB.getDataSource` (part of Play’s `jdbc` dependency).

The solution for Play-Slick integration is the aptly-named
https://github.com/freekh/play-slick[play-slick] library by Typesafe’s
Fredrik Ekholdt (author of Typesafe’s
http://lunatech.com/training/play-2-training[Fast Track to Play]
course). This will likely be built-in to a future version of Play, but
as of version 2.1.3 you have to set it up separately. Let’s see how.

== Summary

To use play-slick to integrate Play and Slick, complete the following
tasks.

[arabic]
. Create a new Play application
. Configure the application to use an in-memory database
. Add the play-slick dependency to the Play application
. Add a database table mapping
. Inspect the generated SQL
. Use a different database driver

== Create a new Play application

Start by creating a new Play/Scala application. On the command line:

\{% highlight text %} $ play new slick-example _ _ _ __ | | __ _ _ _| |
| ’_ | |/ __’ | || |__| | **/|__|___**|__ (__) |__| |__/

play! 2.1.3 (using Java 1.6.0_51 and Scala 2.10.0),
http://www.playframework.org

The new application will be created in
/Users/pedro/Downloads/slick-example

What is the application name? [slick-example] >

Which template do you want to use for this new application?

1 - Create a simple Scala application 2 - Create a simple Java
application

\{% endhighlight %}

== Configure the application to use an in-memory database

Next, configure a database for your Play application. Uncomment the
default H2 in-memory database configuration in `conf/application.conf`:

\{% highlight text %} db.default.driver=org.h2.Driver
db.default.url=``jdbc:h2:mem:play'' db.default.user=sa
db.default.password="" \{% endhighlight %}

== Add the play-slick dependency

To use the play-slick library, it as an application dependency. Edit
`project/Build.scala` and specify this as the only dependency:

\{% highlight scala %} val appDependencies = Seq( ``com.typesafe.play''
%% ``play-slick'' % ``0.4.0'' ) \{% endhighlight %}

Note: play-slick includes the dependency on Play’s JDBC module and
Slick, which is why you don’t need them here.

== Add a database table mapping

To see how Slick works, define a database table in your application.
This is a Scala object defines the mapping between Scala code and the
database. As an example, define a table that will contain a set of
cocktail names, each with a numeric primary key.

In the Play application, create a new database model in
`app/models/database/Cocktails.scala`:

\{% highlight scala %} package models.database

import play.api.db.slick.Config.driver.simple._

class Cocktails extends Tablelink:%22COCKTAIL%22[(Long, String)] \{ def
id = columnlink:%22ID%22[Long] def name = columnlink:%22NAME%22[String]
def * = id ~ name } \{% endhighlight %}

This is a simple mapping that defines a database table called
`COCKTAIL`. The type of each row is `(Long, String)` and the
corresponding columns are called `id` and `name`.

Note that this table mapping is declared as a `class`, instead of as an
`object` as in the Slick documentation examples. Fredrik Ekholdt wrote
that this is better and warned darkly that `you can get (very obscure)
errors in certain situations' if you use objects. You’ve been warned!

Slick also requires a _projection_ called `*`, which defines the default
set of columns for queries. _Projection_ is a mathematical name for a
mapping from a set to a certain kind of subset. In this context, a Slick
projection maps a database table row - a set of columns - to some subset
of the columns. By analogy with the SQL syntax `select * from table`,
the `*` projection is the set of all columns.

== Inspect the generated SQL

The great thing about Slick, assuming that you’re familiar with SQL, is
that the mapping to SQL is very direct. Once you have defined a table,
you can use the Slick API directly to generate the SQL data definition
language (DDL) statements for actually creating the table in the
database.

From the `Cocktails` table, use `(new Cocktails).ddl.createStatements`
to generate a list of SQL DDL statements. In this case, the list will
contain a single `create table` statement. To see this, add the
following to the `controllers.Application.index` controller action.

\{% highlight scala %} import play.api.Logger import
models.database.Cocktails +
import play.api.db.slick.Config.driver.simple._

Logger.debug((new Cocktails).ddl.createStatements.mkString) \{%
endhighlight %}

Note that the log output shows you H2-specific SQL syntax, because
play-slick has used the Slick driver for H2:

\{% highlight sql %} [debug] application - create table ``COCKTAIL''
(``ID'' BIGINT NOT NULL,``NAME'' VARCHAR NOT NULL) \{% endhighlight %}

Slick can also generate SQL for queries, without connecting to a
database. `Query(new Cocktails)` defines an SQL query for the `*`
projection on all of the rows in the `Cocktails` table. Now call
`selectStatement` to generate the resulting SQL:

\{% highlight scala %} Logger.debug(Query(new
Cocktails).selectStatement) \{% endhighlight %}

This outputs the corresponding H2-dialect SQL, which selects the columns
in the projection for all of the rows:

\{% highlight sql %} [debug] application - select x2.``ID'', x2.``NAME''
from ``COCKTAIL'' x2 \{% endhighlight %}

== Use a different database driver

You may want to use a different database in a different environment,
e.g. MySQL for testing. play-slick lets you change database driver
without changing your code, using the Play configuration.

To use MySQL, you first need to add the JDBC driver as an application
dependency. In `Build.scala`, edit the dependencies:

\{% highlight scala %} val appDependencies = Seq( ``com.typesafe.play''
%% ``play-slick'' % ``0.4.0'', ``mysql'' % ``mysql-connector-java'' %
``5.1.18'' ) \{% endhighlight %}

Restart the application with the database driver set to MySQL, by using
a system property to override the application configuration property:

\{% highlight text %} play ``run
-Ddb.default.driver=com.mysql.jdbc.Driver'' \{% endhighlight %}

The log output now shows MySQL-specific SQL syntax, which uses a
different character to quote table names, and specifies the size of
`VARCHAR` columns:

\{% highlight sql %} [debug] application - create table `COCKTAIL` (`ID`
BIGINT NOT NULL,`NAME` VARCHAR(254) NOT NULL) [debug] application -
select x2.`ID`, x2.`NAME` from `COCKTAIL` x2 \{% endhighlight %}

Note that you didn’t change the database URL, which is stil configured
by `db.default.url="jdbc:h2:mem:play"` so you can’t connect to an actual
database and execute SQL statements. All you have done is use Slick to
define table mappings and generate SQL strings.
