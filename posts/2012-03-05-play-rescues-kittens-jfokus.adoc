A few weeks ago, on 14
February 2012, Peter Hilton presented http://www.playframework.org/2.0[Play Framework
2.0] at
http://www.jfokus.se/jfokus/?lang=en&#page=page-1[Jfokus], in
Stockholm. Jfokus, which https://blog.lunatech.com/posts/2012-02-21-jfokus-2012-what-are-java-developers[Ludovico wrote
about]
was an excellent conference and well worth the trip. There was also a
good turn-out for my presentation. Here’s the presentation summary, by
the audience, via Twitter.

There seems to be a lot more interest in Play than a year ago, and five
minutes before the start, there was plenty of anticipation among the
attendees:

____
@pethie: Waiting Play 2.0 presentation #jfokus to start. Seems to be
popular as the room fills up fast.

@pethie: Cool, Play 2.0 presentation is packed. Must have kick ass
content then #Jfokus

@kaivirkki: Eagerly waiting to learn about Play 2.0 at #jfokus. I have
big expectations for the framework!
____

Suspense was then added to the anticipation, giving more time for people
to arrive and fill the room, because the projector wasn’t showing the
slides (not my fault, quickly fixed by the Jfokus technicians):

____
@iamgoddog: Technical problem at Play2.0 lecture at #jfokus Hope we'll
see it soon

@linqon: Waiting for play presentation at #jfokus. Technical
difficulties...
____

Fortunately, lots of people turned by the time I started (photo by
@iamgoddog):

The presentation was on Valentine’s day, so a good day to say that you
love Play:

____
@blockmar: We <3 Play framework! #JFokus
____

I started the presentation by talking about the browser and web
architecture:

____
@per_jansson: I can't believe that not all web frameworks have browser
back button support like Play and GWT. Come on, the app runs in a
browser! #jfokus

@_JamesWard At #Jfokus in @PeterHilton's Play2 session "When a web
framework has an architecture fight with the web, the framework loses"
____

… and added a couple of Internet meme easter eggs.

____
@mraible: Nice! @PeterHilton slipped in a Honey Badger reference and a
Rick Roll on the same slide in his #playframework 2 talk at #jfokus.
____

Next I talked about usablity and developer experience (DX), which is
also a big part of Play:

____
@blockmar: "If you are a scientist or a superhero then maybee you don't
care..." #playframework #JFokus

@matsstrandberg: #jfokus #playframework Peter Hilton: "Code reloading is
very important for DX (Developer Experience)"

@javaHelena: Excellent reminders on good web development by @PeterHilton
in the #playframework 2.0 talk at #jfokus.
____

There are many interesting topics and innovations in Play 2.0, but I’m
interested in templates, so I talked about that:

____
@dvalfrid: Play 2.0 looks really nice, must check it out. #jfokus

@javaHelena: Scala templates in #playframework 2.0 looks quite all
right! #jfokus with @PeterHilton
____

… and about URL-centric design:

____
@yarasenger: At @PeterHilton talk about Play framework. 'you should love
your URLs they are part of your UI' twitpic.com/8jq52v #jfokus
____

At some point, I somehow ended up talking about kittens (photo:

may have been slightly confusing and perhaps a little contrived…

____
@apnylle: "I was somehow distracted while writing this code and wrote
'kittens' instead of 'products'" - @PeterHilton #Jfokus

@cyberzac: #jfokus Peter Hilton: remember #play is cute kittens?
____

… but completely reasonable on balance, because kittens are cute:

____
@iamgoddog: Play is cute kittens #jfokus

@malinljungh: Play -> cute kittens #jfokus

@crichardson: @PeterHilton enjoying your play talk. Thanks. #jfokus
#kittens
____

As well as kittens, I talked about developer productivity:

____
@Nadrendion: Play lets you sleep in and still have time to save the
world in the afternoon. #jfokus And play rescues kittens aswell. Better
check it out!

@crichardson: @PeterHilton enjoying your #playframework talk. Thanks.

@blockmar: Rember: Think Play, think kittens! #jfokus

____

… and CoffeeScript:

____
@KrisJelbring: Compiliation of LESS and CoffeeScript in Play 2. And
kittens. Pretty sweet. #jfokus
____

… and LESS, together with a different feline meme:

____
@Nadrendion: Rainbow as a color in play 2.0 talk #jfokus

@ostergaard: Peter Hilton gets Nyan Cat into his #jfokus presentation.
And in general Play saves kittens. :)
____

Fortunately, not all of the serious points were not obscured by kitten
references:

____
@ostergaard: On the serious side, Peter does a fantastic presentation of
Play 2.0. Feel like programming now! #jfokus

@apnylle: Really great talk about Play 2.0 by @PeterHilton at #jfokus

@KrisJelbring: Thank you @PeterHilton for a great talk on
@playframework!! #jfokus

@jwiberg: Thank you @PeterHilton for nice presentation about Play 2.0 at
#JFokus. Definetily I'm gonna test drive it!
____

Also, some people must have followed my advice to attend
http://bodil.tv/[Bodil Stokke’s] CoffeeScript talk afterwards, which
also featured cat pictures:

____
@htengelin: Hmmm... Mycket katter i presentationerna på #jfokus
____

… including Matt Raible, who blogged about my talk while listening to
Bodil’s:

year, at http://2012.geecon.org/[geecon] and
http://gotocon.com/amsterdam-2012/[GOTO Amsterdam] in May.
