|===

If you’re testing a software application and writing bug reports for a
development team, then you should include four separate pieces of
information for each bug:

[arabic]
. what went wrong - the observed behaviour
. what you did - reproduction steps
. what you expected to happen - the expected behaviour
. the work-around, if there is one.

If you have all of these, the bug is more likely to get fixed, and at
lower cost. Unless you have developers who work for free (in which case
we need to talk), this is a big deal.

== Observed behaviour

Writing down what you saw is the first step: something bad happened, so
you describe it. The trick here is to be specific: include the actual
error message, attach a screenshot that shows a user-interface issue for
copy the exact incorrect calculation result.

These example bug reports are too vague:

____
List of beers is broken. +
Emelisse beer has wrong price. +
User reputation doesn’t go up. +
Bug in beer description.
____

These are better, because they include specific details:

____
List of beers is shown in random order. +
The price for Emelisse Imperial Russian Stout is shown as `NaN'. +
User reputation isn’t recalculated when marking a beer as `tried'. +
Encoding errors in the Provenier Dubbellam description.
____

Including enough detail in the observation is important for two reasons:

[arabic]
. it’s all the developer has to go on if he cannot reproduce the issue
. the developer only knows he’s reproduced the same issue if he can
reproduce exactly the same result.

One more thing: please don’t paste screen shots inside documents in a
document in a word-processor - save an image file instead. If you must
use Windows, then either get a good screen capture tool or paste into MS
Paint (press Win-R, enter *mspaint*, Control-V) and save from there.

== Expected behaviour

As well as describing what happened, it’s helpful if you can also
specify what you expected to happen instead so that the developer knows
what a fix is expected to do.

____
Observed: beers are listed in alphabetical order.
____

With just this observation, a likely response is `so what’s your
point?'. Sometimes it takes an alternative to make it clear that the
current behaviour is wrong.

The expected behaviour may be problematic:

____
Observed: beers are listed in alphabetical order. +
Expected: beers are sorted by popularity.
____

This makes it clear what the fix is, but would be a problem if the
application doesn’t capture popularity. Describing the expected
behaviour helps identify these cases when the actual behaviour is not a
bug, because the expected behaviour is not possible.

== Reproduction steps

When investigating a bug report, the first thing a developer has to do
is reproduce the issue, so they can gather additional details about what
is going on, and be able to confirm that the resulting fix actually
resolves the issue.

As with the description of the observed behaviour, too little detail is
a problem. In fact, you can’t add too much detail here, because of the
huge difference in how long it takes to follow idiot-proof instructions
and how long it takes to work it out for yourself.

This level of detail is described in, er… detail, in
http://blog.lunatech.com/2007/03/08/how-write-user-interface-instructions[How
to write user-interface instructions].

For example, this is going to save time:

____
Reproduction steps:

[arabic]
. Log in as *admin*.
. In the navigation menu, _Administration » Delete beer_.
. On the _Delete beer_ page, open the _Beer_ pick-list.

Observed: list of beers is in random order. +
Expected: beers are sorted alphabetically.
____

Note that we add the expected and observed behaviour immediately after
the step where they apply.

There is an art to writing reproduction steps: making the list as short
as possible. Perhaps it doesn’t matter which user you log in as or
whether you go and get a coffee (or beer) after the second step.
Additional unnecessary steps can mislead the developer who investigates.
In practice, a developer will often try to simplify the steps after
having reproduced the issue, to avoid this.

These reproduction steps are essentially the same as a test-scenario, so
you can use them to test whether the bug is fixed, manually or in an
automated test.

== Work-around

If there’s a work-around then fixing the bug may be less urgent.

____
Observed: `discontinue beer' button doesn’t work.
____

Not being able to use the `discontinue beer' function to remove beer
from the catalogue when it’s no longer in stock could result in a
serious number of disappointed customers.

____
Work-around: use the web service interface to set beer status to
`discontinued'
____

On the other hand, if it’s just as convenient for the catalogue
maintainer to do the same thing another way, then a major issue just
became a minor one, and you can spend your development budget on
something more satisfying.

The work-around is of course optional: you can only add one if you know
one. Even if you don’t, the development team might.

== Bug title

Since you are capturing the bug report in a bug tracker (right?), you
end up with at least one more thing: a title or summary, that is used
for a list of bugs:

____
List of beers should be sorted alphabetically. +
The price for Emelisse Imperial Russian Stout is shown as `NaN'. +
The user’s reputation should go up if they drink beer. +
Encoding errors in the Provenier Dubbellam description.
____

The inconsistency in this list is a result of randomly summarising
either the expected or observed behaviour and using that as the title.
It’s easier if you just use one or the other.

Consistency is easier if you use the observed behaviour as the bug
title:

____
List of beers is shown in random order. +
The price for Emelisse Imperial Russian Stout is shown as `NaN'. +
User reputation isn’t recalculated when marking a beer as `tried'. +
Encoding errors in the Provenier Dubbellam description.
____

Using the expected behaviour instead doesn’t work because the person
reporting the bug might not know what the correct behaviour is. In the
first example, it may be obvious that beers in random order is wrong
(beer order matters!), but not what the correct order is.

== Incomplete bug reports

An incomplete bug report is not necessarily a problem, because sometimes
the expected behaviour is simply that the observed behaviour not happen.

____
Adding a beer to the shopping basket causes a `fatal server error'
____

However, for every bug report that didn’t really need all four parts,
there are always more where they are missing because someone thought
something was obvious when it wasn’t.

The following scenarios slow everyone down:

[arabic]
. The observed behaviour is vague or missing and the developer has to
bounce the report and tell you to try again. If you’re lucky, they’ll
choose their words carefully and avoid accidentally pissing you off in
the process.
. The reproduction steps are missing, and the developer has to choose
between spending time trying to discover how to reproduce the bug
instead of something more useful, or bouncing the bug and having to wait
for more information, causing a delay. Or both.
. The expected behaviour is not described and the developer has to avoid
either implementing the wrong fix or spending extra time trying to
discover what you want.

In the long run, it takes less time to include all of the information
than to think about whether it’s all needed and then fix the problem in
the case where missing information was. Not all laziness is
constructive.

== Conclusion

Better bug reports save time, and time is a lot of money, because
software maintenance is expensive. Fortunately, it only takes a little
discipline and practice to write better bug reports.
