:title: How to demo the Play framework 1.2 - live coding script
:tags: [playframework,java]

If you want
someone to know how fast and straightforward it is to build a Java web
application with the http://www.playframework.org/[Play framework],
then *show*, don't *tell*. The most compelling way to do this is to
download Play 1.2 and start coding a web application from scratch, while
they watch. This article is a script for a five-minute live-coding Play
demo.

This script is based on how I have seen Play's creator, Guillaume Bort,
demonstrate Play to introduce it to a small audience. More or less the
same demo, but with Ajax, is the video on the front page of
http://www.playframework.org/. This is an especially good way of showing
Play to a small group of people, if you are fairly fluent with the
framework, because you can answer questions about how you do something
by just writing the code and showing it working far more quickly than
you would be able to with other frameworks.

== Summary

. Download the Play framework.
. Create and run the application.
. Inspect the set-up for the default welcome page.
. Replace the welcome page with a trivial dynamic template.
. Generate a Java compilation error.
. Retrieve HTTP request parameters.
. Show message file content in the template
. Add the project to Eclipse.
. Add a JPA Entity.
. Add an HTML form for creating entity instances.
. Add a link for deleting each instance.
. Use a Java extensions in the view template.
. Add form validation.

[[create]]
== Create and run the application

*Open* http://www.playframework.org/ Download the binary

____
There is no need to _install_ Play as such, although you might want to
add the download's directory to your `PATH`, so you can execute the
`$PLAY_HOME/play` commmand directly. On my machine, though, it's just as
easy to just type `~/Downloads/play-1.2.4/play` for this kind of demo.
____

*Execute* `play new tasks ~ What is the application name? tasks`

____
A task list application is an easy example for people to understand, but
it is more fun to pick an example that is more familiar and relevant to
your audience, such as 'customers' or 'cocktails'.
____

*Execute* `find tasks -type f` (optional) - List the generated files

____
It is crucial to note that Play has not generated a lot of code here;
the files are minimal stubs that you will only add to, rather than a lot
of generated code that you will have to delete.
____

*Execute* `play run tasks` - Start the Play server runtime to run the
application.

____
Depending on what you are used to, start-up time may seem extremely
short.
____

*Open* http://localhost:9000/ - Show welcome page.

____
The welcome page describes how the stub application works, which the
next few steps show.
____

*Start* a text editor.

____
You could use an IDE, such as Eclipse, already at this point. However,
it is useful to start with a plain text editor to make it clear that you
do not have to compile the Java code yourself.
____

*Edit* `conf/routes` - Show the route for the `GET /` HTTP request.

____
Since Play has an HTTP focus, in incoming HTTP request is a good
starting point for explaining how it works. The `routes` file, is
therefore crucial, because this defines the (two-way) mapping between
HTTP requests and Java methods.
____

*Edit* `app/controllers/Application.java` - Show the `index()` method.

*Edit* `app/views/main.html` - Show the default template: HTML 5, CSS
and jQuery.

*Edit* `app/views/Application/index.html` - Show the `#{welcome /`} tag
and replace it with `<h1>Tasks</h1>`.

*Open* http://localhost:9000/ - Show the heading.

*Edit* `public/stylesheets/main.css` - Add some CSS to make things less
ugly:

[source,brush:,css;,gutter:,false]
----
html { border-top: 5px solid #67A927;  }
body { font-family:"Helvetica Neue"; padding:2em; background: #F7F7F7 url(/public/playmanual/logo.png) no-repeat 98% 20%; }
body:before { content:'Play task list demo'; color:#568C00; font-size:150%; text-transform:uppercase; letter-spacing:0.4em; }
ul { padding:0; list-style:none; }
li, form { width:30em; background:white; padding:1em; border:1px solid #ccc; border-radius:0.5em; margin:1em 0; position:relative; }
li a { text-decoration:none; color:transparent; position:absolute; top:1em; right:1em; }
li a:after { content:'❎'; color:#aaa; font-size:120%; font-weight:bold; }
form * { font-size:120%; }
input { width:16em; }
button { cursor:pointer; color: white; background-color: #3D6F04; background-image: -webkit-linear-gradient(top, #5AA706, #3D6F04); text-shadow: 0 -1px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.25); border: 1px solid #CCC; border-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1) rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1) rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.25); border-radius:4px; }
p.error { margin:0; color:#c00; }
----

[[template]]
== Show dynamic data in the template

*Edit* `app/views/Application/index.html` - Change the heading to
`<h1>${items}</h1>`.

*Edit* `app/controllers/Application.java` - Change the `index()` method
body to the following (omitting a semi-colon).

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false]
----
final String items = "Things"
render(items);
----

*Open* http://localhost:9000/ - Show the Java compilation error.

*Edit* `app/controllers/Application.java` - Add the missing semi-colon.

*Open* http://localhost:9000/ - Show the new heading, and Java changes
without compilation or deployment.

*Edit* `app/controllers/Application.java` - Replace the `items`
declaration line with a `String items` method parameter.

*Open* http://localhost:9000/?items=Things

*Edit* `app/controllers/Application.java` - Undo the last change -
remove the parameter and put the declaration back.

[[messages]]
== Show message file content in the template

*Edit* `app/views/Application/index.html` - Change the heading to
`<h1>&{'model.shipments'}</h1>`.

*Open* http://localhost:9000/ - Show the message key being displayed,
because the message is not defined.

*Edit* `conf/messages` - Add the line `model.shipments = Shipments`

*Open* http://localhost:9000/ - Show the message being displayed.

== Eclipse

*Execute* `Control+C` - Show how little logging there is by default.

*Execute* `play eclipsify tasks` - Generate Eclipse project and class
path configuration.

*Eclipse* _File » Import… » Existing projects into workspace_ - Show
project structure.

*Eclipse* `eclipse/tasks.launch` » Run » tasks - Start the Play server
runtime from within Eclipse.

*Open* http://localhost:9000/ - Show the application running.

[[idea]]
== IntelliJ IDEA

*Execute* `Control+C` - Show how little logging there is by default.

*Execute* `play idealize tasks` - Generate IDEA project and class path
configuration.

*Execute* `open tasks/tasks.ipr` - Open the project in IDEA.

*Execute* `play run tasks` - Start the Play server again.

[[jpa]]
== JPA entity

*Edit* `app/models` - create class:

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false]
----
@Entity
public class Task extends play.db.jpa.Model {

   public String title;
}
----

____
At this point you may need to explain that `Task` is a Java Bean at
run-time, because Play dynamically adds getter and setter methods for
the public fields, turning them into normal Java Bean properties.
____

*Edit* `app/controllers/Application.java` - Change the `index()` method
body to

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false]
----
List tasks = Task.findAll();
render(tasks);
----

*Edit* `app/views/Application/index.html` - After the heading, add:

[source,brush:,html;,gutter:,false]
----
<ul>
#{list tasks, as:'task'}
   <li>${task.title}</li>
#{/list}
</ul>
----

*Open* http://localhost:9000/ - Show the JPA error.

*Edit* `conf/application.conf` - Uncomment the line `# db=mem`

*Open* http://localhost:9000/ - Show the page - no tasks.

[[html]]
== HTML form

*Edit* `app/views/Application/index.html` - After the list, add:

[source,brush:,html;,gutter:,false]
----
#{form @add()}
<p>
  <input name="task.title" autofocus>
  <button type="submit">Add Task</button>
</p>
#{/form}
----

*Edit* `app/controllers/Application.java` - Add the method:

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false]
----
public static void add(final Task task) {
   task.save();
   index();
}
----

*Open* http://localhost:9000/ - Add tasks.

[[link]]
== Command link

*Edit* `app/views/Application/index.html` - Inside the `<li>` add a
link:

[source,brush:,html;,gutter:,false]
----
<a href="@{delete(task.id)}">delete</a>
----

____
As for forms, there is also a tag for generating links; this way just
generates the URL.
____

*Edit* `conf/routes` - Add `GET /delete Application.delete`

*Edit* `app/controllers/Application.java` - Add the method, noting the
`id` parameter:

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false]
----
public static void delete(final Long id) {
   Task task = Task.findById(id);
   task.delete();
   index();
}
----

*Open* http://localhost:9000/ - Delete tasks - show the link URL and
query string parameter.

*Edit* `conf/routes` - Change the delete route to
`GET /delete/{id} Application.delete`

*Open* http://localhost:9000/ - Delete tasks - show the link URL and URL
path parameter.

[[extensions]]
== Java extensions

*Edit* `app/views/Application/index.html` - Change the heading to:

[source,brush:,html;,gutter:,false]
----
<h1>${tasks.size()} Task${tasks.pluralize()}</h1>
----

*Open* http://localhost:9000/ - Add/delete tasks to show singular and
plural forms.

____
If you are lucky, at this point someone in the audience will be smart
enough to point out that some plurals are not just formed by adding an
's', at which point you can change the example, and show the `pluralize`
method with one or more parameters, e.g.
`${tasks.pluralize(messages.get('task'), messages.get('tasks'))`}
____

[[validation]]
== Form validation

*Edit* `app/controllers/Application.java` - Add the `@Valid` annotation
to the add method's `Shipment` parameter, replace the first line of the
method body (`Task.save();`) with the following.

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false]
----
if (validation.hasErrors()) {
   validation.keep();
}
else {
   task.save();         
}
----

*Edit* `app/views/Application/index.html` - immediately after the `form`
tag, add:

[source,brush:,html;,gutter:,false]
----
#{errors}
    <p class="error">${error}</p>
#{/errors}
----

*Open* http://localhost:9000/ - Show the validation error when
submitting an empty name.

____
The validation error is just 'Required', but we can change this.
____

*Edit* `conf/messages` - Add the line
`validation.required = %s is a required field`

*Open* http://localhost:9000/ - Show the new validation error.

____
Now we get the field name, but not as a formatted label.
____

*Edit* `conf/messages` - Change the placeholder in `validation.required`
to `&{{ "{%s" }}`}, and add the line `task.name = Task name`

*Open* http://localhost:9000/ - Show the new validation error.

____
This lists validation errors in one place. A better way is to list the
errors next to each field.
____

*Edit* `app/views/Application/index.html` - Replace the errors tag with:

[source,brush:,html;,gutter:,false]
----
#{ifErrors}
    <p class="error">Validation failed</p>
#{/ifErrors}
----

… and after the text input and button, before the closing `form` tag,
add:

[source,brush:,html;,gutter:,false]
----
<p class="error">#{error 'task.title'/}</p>
----

*Open* http://localhost:9000/ - Show the new validation error.
