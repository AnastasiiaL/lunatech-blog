presents]

At this point, we had already been using the Play Framework for a couple
of years. In 2012, we lost our early-adopter advantage, because Play
started to gain publicity and become more mainstream, so we switched our
focus to helping other people learn about and use Play. We continued to
benefit from Play on development projects, but now that everyone else
was too, this was a good time to getting some publicity from our
expertise.

== Development

http://blog.lunatech.com/2012/01/10/late-christmas[Late Christmas at
Lunatech] was a great start to the year, with new development hardware.
Some people like coding in cafes and on trains, but I hate being very
far from a 27 inch Thunderbolt display.

http://blog.lunatech.com/2012/11/20/planning-scrum-project-documentation[Planning
Scrum project documentation] is one of half a dozen 2012 blog posts
about aspects of using Scrum, written as a result of another assignment
as an interim Scrum master and coach for a customer’s development team.
Although Scrum wasn’t new for Lunatech in 2012, this was when our
existing customers started to use it more.

http://blog.lunatech.com/2013/04/19/good-bug-reports-come-in-four-parts[Good
bug reports come in four parts] is probably the most important but
boring article that no-one read in 2012, that was still worth writing
just on the off-chance that one bug report somewhere would be less
terrible than usual.

== Events

Apart from several Play Framework user groups, Lunatech’s involvement
with events was dominated by Play presentations at European developer
conferences:

* http://blog.lunatech.com/2012/02/07/playframework-jfokus-2012[Lunatech
presents Play at Jfokus 2012]
* http://blog.lunatech.com/2012/05/15/playframework-geecon-2012[Lunatech

presents Play at Øredev 2012]

http://blog.lunatech.com/2012/02/08/scala-stockholm[Lunatech presents at
Scala Stockholm] was the scariest presentation though, because although
the audience was smaller, it was somewhat intimidating to say anything
at all about Scala with Viktor Klang and Jonas Bonér in the audience.

http://blog.lunatech.com/2012/05/09/first-010dev-event[First 010DEV
event] was probably the most fun event of the year, as we re-invented
our local developer user group (previously JBoss User Group and
Play!ground) as a technology-independent developer community focused on
people in Rotterdam (whose telephone area code is 010).
