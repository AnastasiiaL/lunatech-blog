Did you know we have an http://www.lunatech-labs.com[open-source web
site]?

We release all our open-source projects there, as a way to give back to
the open-source community we use and abuse every day and without which
we’d be knee-deep stuck in proprietary code, inscrutable bugs and opaque
security.

Our first such project is
http://www.lunatech-labs.com/open-source/jax-doclets[jax-doclets]: a
JavaDoc extension that uses Java comments to document your JAXB
resources and JAX-RS web services. Today we released version 0.7,

hot.
