If there’s a pattern to what was new in 2013, it is perhaps increasing
diversity. There were more approaches to running software projects,
rather than all trying to use Scrum, more programming languages, rather
than only using Scala, and more conferences than just Devoxx.

== Software development

http://blog.lunatech.com/2013/08/05/lunatech-feeds-happy-melly[Lunatech
feeds Happy Melly] was, I think, the most import new thing in software
development for us (as a company and as an industry) last year. Working
with Happy Melly was our first taste of a different kind of
customer-supplier relationship, combined with the next level of agile
software development beyond Scrum, using Kanban with #NoEstimates.

http://blog.lunatech.com/2013/07/22/playframework-training-certification[Fast
Track to Play training certification] was perhaps a final step in
applying our Play framework experience, followed only by finally
publishing the http://www.manning.com/hilton/[Play for Scala] book in
October 2013. Typesafe’s training certification is the formalised
version of the Play consultancy that we were already selling.

http://blog.lunatech.com/2013/04/19/good-bug-reports-come-in-four-parts[Good
bug reports come in four parts] was 2013’s entry in the `how everyone
can do a thing better but unfortunately don’t care about' category. It
would be nice if software development project team members did actually
care, but unfortunately it still seems to be okay to write terrible bug
reports. Perhaps this is one of the truly hard problems of enterprise
IT.

== Coding tutorials

http://blog.lunatech.com/2013/01/24/ios-core-data-sqlite-full-text-search[iOS
full-text search with Core Data and SQLite] is Wolfert’s tutorial for
iOS developers, based on work on an iOS application for one of our
customers. This is the kind of technique that is probably too specific
to expect to be `in the manual' but that you hope Google finds when you
need to do the same thing yourself.

The series of Typesafe Slick tutorials, on the other hand, are simply
describing the basics more carefully than Slick’s very concise manual
does:

* link:[Getting started with Play and Slick 1.0.1]
* link:[Using the Scala console with Play and Slick 1.0.1]
* link:[Defining database table columns with Slick 1.0.1]
* link:[Using Play framework database evolutions with Slick 1.0.1]
* link:[Defining database queries with Slick 1.0.1]
* link:[Executing database queries with Slick 1.0.1]
* link:[Mapping Slick query results to case classes 1.0.1]

As of mid-2014, we’re still waiting for someone _else_ to write a good
book about Slick, which turns out to be a very useful but
barely-documented database access technology. Meanwhile, note that
making the Slick 1.0.1 tutorials work with the latest version of Slick 2
is left as an exercise for the reader.

== Events

http://blog.lunatech.com/2013/03/07/summary-of-joy-of-coding-2013[The
Joy of Coding 2013] was the year’s first first - a cool new conference
in Rotterdam that we really enjoyed.

http://blog.lunatech.com/2013/05/27/sdu-royal-ten[Sdu Royal Ten - 10km
business run] followed the previous team running event with another in
the Hague, this time with an official photo (above).

http://blog.lunatech.com/2013/04/28/clojure-meetup-at-lunatech[Lunatech
Hosts and Sponsors Clojure Meetup] was the other first: Clojure
developer events at Lunatech. Because there’s always a more obscure
programming language with a single supporter in the company (Vijay) than
whatever else you’re already using, however new and shiny.
