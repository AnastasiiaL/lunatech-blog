:title: Defining database table columns with Slick 1.0.1  
:tags: [slick,playframework]

This tutorial shows you how to define different kinds of database \
    columns (a.k.a. _attributes_) in a [Slick](http://slick.typesafe.com) \
    application.

https://blog.lunatech.com/posts/2013-08-13-play-slick-scala-console[Using the
Scala console with Play and Slick] shows how to use a
http://www.playframework.com[Play Framework] application’s Scala console
to inspect the SQL that Slick generates for a database table definition.
The example used a trivial table definition, with simple columns.

In practice, you need to know how to specify additional properties and
constraints. After all, although relational databases aren’t especially
strongly typed, not everything is a `VARCHAR NOT NULL`.

== Summary

You’ll need to know how to complete the following tasks.

[arabic]
. Defining a nullable column
. Defining a primary key column
. Defining a foreign key relationship
. Defining a unique key constraint
. Using database-specific types

== Defining a nullable column

A trivial table definition with a single `String` column results in a
`VARCHAR NOT NULL` column. To see this, use the instructions for
https://blog.lunatech.com/posts/2013-13-play-slick-scala-console[using the
Scala console with Play and Slick] to start a Play application on the
console. Then paste the following console transcript into the Play
application’s Scala console.

[source,scala,linenums]
----
scala> import play.api.db.slick.Config.driver.simple._
import play.api.db.slick.Config.driver.simple._

scala> class Cocktails extends Table[(String)]("COCKTAIL") {
	 |   def name = column[String]("NAME")
	 |   def * = name
	 | }
defined class Cocktails

scala> (new Cocktails).ddl.createStatements.mkString
res1: String = create table "COCKTAIL" ("NAME" VARCHAR NOT NULL)

----


This example is using a Play application whose configuration defines
`db.default.driver=org.h2.Driver`, so this is the H2 database’s SQL
dialect.

For a nullable column, you need SQL DDL without the `NOT NULL` option on
the `NAME` column. In the Slick table definition, declare the column’s
type as `Option[String]`.

[source,scala,linenums]
----
scala> class Cocktails extends Table[(Option[String])]("COCKTAIL") {
	 |   def name = column[Option[String]]("NAME")
	 |   def * = name
	 | }
defined class Cocktails

scala> (new Cocktails).ddl.createStatements.mkString
res2: String = create table "COCKTAIL" ("NAME" VARCHAR)
----


Don’t forget that the column types in the `Table` type parameter must
match the individual `column` type parameters, or you’ll get a `type
mismatch' compilation error for the `*` projection.

== Defining a primary key column

You probably want all of your database tables to have a _synthetic
primary key_ - a generated numeric key that is independent of
application data and has no meaning other than entity identity. In
database terms, this means declaring a column with a primary key
constraint and a generation strategy.

Slick provides _column options_ for primary keys and auto-incrementing
values: `O.PrimaryKey` and `O.AutoInc`, where `O` is the `Table` class’
column options field. Add these column options as additional parameters
to the `id` column definition.

[source,scala,linenums]
----
class Cocktails extends Table[(Long, String)]("COCKTAIL") {
  def id = column[Long]("ID", O.PrimaryKey, O.AutoInc)
  def name = column[String]("NAME")
  def * = id ~ name
}
----

This results in the following SQL DDL, for H2.

[source,sql,linenums]
----
create table "COCKTAIL" (
  "ID" BIGINT GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY(START WITH 1) NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
  "NAME" VARCHAR NOT NULL)
----

For comparison, here’s the equivalent syntax that Slick’s MySQL driver generates.

[source,sql,linenums]
----
create table `COCKTAIL` (
  `ID` BIGINT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  `NAME` VARCHAR(254) NOT NULL)
----

There’s a benefit of Slick here: column options like `O.PrimaryKey` and
`O.AutoInc` are easier to read and remember than the corresponding
database-specific SQL DDL syntax. This is especially helpful if you
don’t always use the same database.

== Defining a foreign key relationship

Perhaps the next addition in any non-trivial database is a foreign key
relationship, which you need for efficient join queries. After all, a
database without joins is just a spreadsheet, which is less cool.

First, use what you’ve learned so far to define another table to use as
the target of your foreign key relationship. Continuing with the mixed
drinks example, define a table for the main ingredient in each cocktail.
Tequila, for example.

[source,scala,linenums]
----
class Ingredients extends Table[(Long, String)]("INGREDIENT") {
  def id = column[Long]("ID", O.PrimaryKey, O.AutoInc)
  def name = column[String]("NAME")
  def * = id ~ name
}
----

To start with, you just do the obvious thing: add a `mainIngredientId`
column to the cocktails table to store an `Ingedients.id` value:

[source,scala,linenums]
----
class Cocktails extends Table[(Long, String, Long)]("COCKTAIL") {
  def id = column[Long]("ID", O.PrimaryKey, O.AutoInc)
  def name = column[String]("NAME")
  def mainIngredientId = column[Long]("MAIN_INGREDIENT_ID")
  def * = id ~ name ~ mainIngredientId
}
----

Note that the `mainIngredientId` column’s type is `Long`, which matches
the ID type that you used for `Ingedients.id`. The additional column is
not enough, though; you also need to add a foreign key constraint. For
that, you need an additional member in the `Cocktails` table definition.

[source,scala,linenums]
----
def mainIngredient = foreignKey("MAIN_INGREDIENT_FK", mainIngredientId, new Ingredients)(_.id)
----

You need four parameters to define the foreign key:

* `"MAIN_INGREDIENT_FK"` - the constraint name
* `mainIngredientId` - the foreign key column
* `new Ingredients` - the foreign key reference’s target table
* `_.id` - the referenced column in the target table - its primary key.

Bringing this all together, by pasting the definitions in the Scala
console as before, you get the following DDL (for H2).

[source,sql,linenums]
----
create table "COCKTAIL" (
  "ID" BIGINT GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY(START WITH 1) NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
  "NAME" VARCHAR NOT NULL,
  "MAIN_INGREDIENT_ID" BIGINT NOT NULL)

alter table "COCKTAIL" add constraint "MAIN_INGREDIENT_FK"
  foreign key("MAIN_INGREDIENT_ID") references "INGREDIENT"("ID")
  on update NO ACTION on delete NO ACTION
----

Now there are two SQL statements: a Slick table’s DDL is not necessarily
a single SQL statement. Don’t forget to add a semicolon at the end of
each statement if you want to execute them as an SQL script.

== Defining a unique key constraint

You may want to constrain cocktail names to be unique, which makes
sense, because there’s only one (right) way to make a Margarita. For
this, you need to add a database-level uniqueness constraint.

Unique key constraints are similar to foreign key contraints -
essentially another database index. The Slick definition is similar to
the foreign key declaration, but in this case is just a named index for
the `name` column, with an option for the uniqueness constraint.

[source,scala,linenums]
----
def uniqueName = index("IDX_NAME", name, unique = true)
----

The resulting H2 SQL syntax turns out to be equally straightforward.

[source,sql,linenums]
----
create unique index "IDX_NAME" on "COCKTAIL" ("NAME")
----

== Using database-specific types

So far, you’ve only used the default mapping from Scala types to
database types. However, this is not always what you want. For example,
the default mapping for `String` columns is a limited-size `VARCHAR`
type.

If you add a `recipe` column to the `Cocktails` table, you’ll need to
allow for thousands of characters (because making good cocktails is all
about getting the details right). In this case, you need to use the SQL
standard CLOB (character large object) type.

You specify an alternative column type using the same kind of column
option that you use to specify a primary key:

[source,scala,linenums]
----
def recipe = column[Option[String]]("RECIPE", O.DBType("CLOB"))
----

In this definition, `"CLOB"` is the database-specific SQL DDL syntax, not Slick
syntax. This is just passed-through to the resulting SQL DDL without being
checked by Slick:


[source,sql,linenums]
----
create table "COCKTAIL" (
  "ID" BIGINT GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY(START WITH 1) NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
  "NAME" VARCHAR NOT NULL,
  "RECIPE" CLOB,
  "MAIN_INGREDIENT_ID" BIGINT NOT NULL)
----

Similarly, you might use this to specify a type with a particular
precision, such as mapping money values to a MySQL fixed-precision
numeric type, with `O.DBType("DECIMAL(13,2)")`.
