Many courses and trainings will take place this month at our Rotterdam offices. The first of the series is "Lightbend Spark for Scala-Professional".

This two-day course is designed to teach developers how to implement data analytics using Apache Spark, an open-source cluster-computing framework for Reactive applications. 

This course allows Full Stack Developers and Devops to dive into the world of modern data analytics. This will be a valuable addition for the personal development of the participants. Which is also beneficial for https://www.linkedin.com/company/52358/[Lunatech]'s tech-stack of course.
