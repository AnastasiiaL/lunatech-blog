This year I bit the bullet and got myself rid of a
decade-old relationship with Nokia to get a phone with a good Internet
experience. I then used this new phone on vacation instead of the usual
laptop to stay connected. Here's a list of things I've learned during
this experiment.

I've always been a big fan of [.nobr]#http://www.nokia.com/[Nokia]#. I
was blown away in 1999 when I could trigger calls by voice on my first
Nokia phone. It had a UI to type in music for your custom ringtone
(which subsequent models made obsolete by allowing
[.nobr]#http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_Instrument_Digital_Interface[MIDI]#,
but that was only better). This is so handy when driving since it
doesn't require you to touch or even look at the phone. My second Nokia
phone had a modem in it, so it did tethering. Around 2005 it had
[.nobr]#http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SyncML[SyncML]# and let me sync my
contacts with GMail (that was a bit later). Ever since the first phone I
could [.nobr]#http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_PC_Suite[sync the phone
contacts]# with the computer using Windows first, then
[.nobr]#http://www.gammu.org[Linux]#. Since I hated typing on the phone
I sent my SMS using Linux, by connecting with the phone. Ever since 2000
I was able to send my [.nobr]#http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VCard[vCard]#
using SMS and infrared, then later Bluetooth.

Few people can say that their contacts list grew from 1999 to 2009
without ever being lost or typed in manually on new phones. My contact
list went from my first phone in vCard format to the second, then all
the way until it went to GMail using SyncML and from there to newer
phones using synchronisation. I never lost it or entered it by hand on
new phones. It just grew and evolved.

Over the years I grew very attached to the simple and stable interface
of Nokia phones and their feature sets. Naturally I also noticed some
flaws, like when my new phone did want me to record the names of the
contacts for voice-controlled calls anymore, but used some sort of
analysis of my voice and compared it how the phone thought I should be
pronouncing names. Needless to say I was never able to get the hang of
how the phone wanted me to pronounce anyone's name, including my own
wife. At some point the phones got
[.nobr]#http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3G[3G]# (around 2005 probably) and
naturally included a browser which would take ages to render any page
and crash most of the time, effectively rendering it useless. I skipped
the whole
[.nobr]#http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_Application_Protocol[WAP]#
thing.

== [#Searchingforanewphone]####Searching for a new phone

In 2007 I was finally accepting the fact that I expected my phone to do
internet browsing and email correctly, and decided to get one as soon as
I would find one with the following features:

* Large [.nobr]#http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-touch[multi-touch]#
screen
* 3G with a good navigator and email application
* Bluetooth (for headsets and sending vCards)
* MMS (for sending pictures in case of emergency such as “Do I buy this
or that?”)
* Voice-command calls
* Synchronization (SyncML preferably)
* Good battery charge

I never could get used to the idea of using an
[.nobr]#http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone[iPhone]# 1 or 3G since too
many of my requested features were missing, but when the iPhone 3GS came
out, and the price was fair (150€ with a contract renewal) I couldn't
wait for
[.nobr]#http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)[Android]#
or Nokia phones to get there fast enough, so I reluctantly bought an
[.nobr]#http://www.apple.com[Apple]# product.

== [#Firstimpressions]####First impressions

At first I was a bit disappointed I had to reboot to Windows and install
the dreaded [.nobr]#http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITunes[iTunes]#
application which only recently
[.nobr]#http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brick_(electronics)[bricked]# my
[.nobr]#http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPod[iPod]#, and whose user
interface I never understood. Nevertheless, those are the rules. Then
I'm very surprised because I learn that if you want to install (or just
browse) applications (even free ones) on the iPhone you need to give
your credit card number to Apple. Needless to say I never gave mine to
Nokia. This is a really cunning move from Apple, not one that I like one
bit.

After I set up iTunes and stuff, it allows me to use the iPhone. This
gets me into trouble I will describe next.

== [#Contactssynchronisation]####Contacts synchronisation

As I mentioned all my contacts are in GMail, and there is just such an
option to import then from GMail. Turns out this got me all my contacts
in the iPhone with the first and last names reversed. I then discovered
that since my contacts list evolved from my first vCard capable phone in
1999 some had their names set in only one field, while others had the
proper "first name, last name" decomposition. As of today the GMail
contacts interface still doesn't allow you to set those as two fields,
although once you export your contacts list to a vCard you can see which
ones are correct and fix those that are not properly decomposed.

Once you fix your contact list, you can re import it in GMail and it
works. At least it works if you don't mind losing any associated contact
image and [.nobr]#http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Talk[GTalk]#
handle. It took me a while to fix that, but then I discovered that what
I really wanted was to use the "Exchange Server" synchronisation with
GMail. That got me not only the contacts list but also the calendar. It
also fixed whatever issues I had with the "GMail contacts
synchronisation" I cannot recall now.

I have to say it now works like a charm for both the calendars and
contacts.

If you're looking for how to chose which calendars to sync with your
iPhone, try

== [#Freeapplicationsyoumusthave]####Free applications you must have

Here's a list of free applications I found useful for the iPhone:

* Google Earth: let's face it it is just as useful as Google Maps, but
much more eye candy ;)
* Google: mostly for the handy shortcuts
* eBuddy: the "all Instant Messenging accounts" application you must
have
* Facebook: much faster than their web site for this phone
* Twitterific: a fast and simple
[.nobr]#http://www.twitter.com[Twitter]# client
* Torch: turn your phone into a lamp

== [#Freeapplicationsyoumusthave%28inFrance%29]####Free applications you must have (in France)

If you are living in France, chances are you'll be interested in the
following:

* Le Monde.fr: if you want to read the headlines, it's even better than
their iPhone dedicated web site
* PagesJaunes: if you ever look for a phone number, it's better than
their iPhone dedicated web site

== [#ListofthingsthatareannoyingontheiPhone]####List of things that are annoying on the iPhone

When I went on vacation this year I thought I could avoid taking my
laptop with me and use the iPhone for all the browsing and mail I needed
to do while away. After a few weeks of experience with the iPhone as my
primary internet access, I have written down a list by no order of
importance some of the shortcomings and frustration I've had with the
iPhone:

* [line-through]*No alternate "From" address in the mail application*.
This is terrible if like me you have several email addresses and need to
change the "From" address when sending mail. I have one for work, one
for home, one for the [.nobr]#http://www.rivierajug.org[Riviera JUG]#,
several for different mailing lists I'm subscribed to. Fact is I just
could not send any mail on behalf of the Riviera JUG and all mails sent
to mailing lists were rejected since my "From" address could not be
changed to the registered one. *It turns out that this is supported*
provided you can type all your alternate addresses separated by a comma
in the account address settings. If you're wondering why the manual
doesn't mention this or why the particular setting's keyboard does not
let you type a comma, then welcome to the club. You have to copy a comma
from somewhere else and use the paste function to type it in this field.
Wow.
* You can view attachments (like PDF) but not save them. In fact I
haven't been able to figure out why you can't save anything on the
iPhone, but when you must save an attachment to upload it to a web site,
fact is you're out of luck.
* Copy/paste, just like automatic landscape rotation is something that
will work on some applications while not in others. This is not
necessarily the iPhone's fault, but it's fairly annoying that landscape
doesn't work in Twitterific, Facebook and eBuddy, and copy/paste doesn't
work in eBuddy (try grabbing a URL there).
* Internationalisation is just not good enough. In French I need to be
able to type accents often, and they are hard to get (impossible to
guess where they hide also, you must see the manual). That makes typing
in French really slow. Also they should have changed the symbols order
for specific languages like French.
* Sometimes you lose the 3G or
[.nobr]#http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Packet_Radio_Service[GPRS]#
connection and your best bet is to reboot it. Why does it take up to a
minute to shut down?
* The lack of background apps is very annoying if you use this as your
primary internet connection. Luckily some applications save enough state
to reduce this limitation, and some others use
[.nobr]#http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Push_technology[Push]# to notify
you of things to check out in a non-running app, but not all
applications so this is annoying.
* The GPS is often wrong by a few kilometers. In the 3 places I've tried
it, it put me on the beach when I was in the mountains, in a different
valley or in a different part of town. I'm glad I don't use this.
* I still haven't found how to type the degree sign (I hear there's a
Japanese keyboard workaround): 30°C anyone?
* It's missing user profiles: when you share it with people for a while,
you want it to know that everyone has different mail accounts, contacts
and facebook profiles for instance. I know this is a feature missing
from most (if not all) other phones. It made sense to not have that on
non-internet phones, but on a device which is not only a phone but also
an internet tablet, I expect a few ubiquitous computer idioms such as
those. I wouldn't mind if Apple were the first to implement it on a
smart phone.
* Although the iPhone can present you with several contacts list (from
different mail accounts probably) you can only add one Active Sync
server, which means if your wife and you have different address books on
GMail you cannot see both.
* The spell checker is just plain awful. It almost always turns what
you're typing into what you don't want to type and requires you to look
at what you're typing and be really fast in going up to tap on its wrong
suggestion to remove it before it transforms your correct word into
gibberish. It's a game I just don't like to play. Please give me
underlined words and a one-step correction.
* Battery life is terrible. Sometimes you want Wifi, Bluetooth, Push and
automatic synchronisation, while other times you want battery life.
There is no single button ready to press that says "Save my battery"
that disables all these in the hope that your phone lasts more than one
day without you even calling.
* I hear there's an iPod part in there. I have my own iPod with a much
bigger disk space and I use it with Linux (I hear iPhones just
[.nobr]#http://marcansoft.com/blog/2009/01/using-amarok-and-other-itunesdb-compatible-software-with-the-iphone-2x/[don't
play nice]#). But yesterday I clicked on an mp3 podcast on a web site
and expected the file to be added to the iPod so I could listen to it in
the car (which talks to iPods). I was completely amazed not to see the
iPod app show up but instead a lame
[.nobr]#http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QuickTime[QuickTime]# player
interface (which worked, but didn't let me connect it to the car, or
save it for later). This is really lame.
* I still didn't find how to send vCards using Bluetooth.
* After hesitating a while, when I found a few minutes of time while on
vacation I decided to try downloading a movie from iTunes. I was ready
to pay for it, but the lack of Wifi prevented me from buying any movie
on iTunes from the iPhone. I thought that was rather lame, what's the
point really? People at home have better devices to watch movies on than
small iPhone screens…
* image:maps.gif[image]The Google Maps application icon uses a
locale-specific road sign (the 280 part), which makes this icon a puzzle
for most of the world (including me). This sign means so much nothing to
me that I can look at each individual icon on the iPhone initial app
list (one screen only) and still not guess which is the Google Maps
application. Please change it.

== [#Conclusion]####Conclusion

While the iPhone is certainly a step forward in terms of Internet
browsing (crashy at best on my previous phone) and email (inexistent on
my previous phone), it leaves a lot to be desired. This is the third
phone Apple makes, so I was expecting that it didn't have enough
background on the subject to do everything right, but let's just say I
was just as pleasantly surprised by the many nice features it has (which
I didn't talk about here, there are enough Apple fan sites around) as I
was amazed at some of the limitations it has.

All in all I'm still happy I made the move since I wanted proper
Internet connectivity on my phone and I did get that. I would also be
damned if I knew which other phone would be better, since it's really
easy to know what the iPhone does with all the hype, but pretty hard to
get a good idea what the many competing phones allow you to do.
