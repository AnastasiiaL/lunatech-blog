:title: Lunatech Advisory Board Member At Scala Center!
:tags: [event,scala]

For the 10th year’s anniversary of Scala Lunatech got the opportunity to be a Platinum sponsor at https://scaladays.org/2019/lausanne/schedule[ScalaDays]. The event took place this year in the beautiful EPFL of Lausanne, Scala’s places of birth and home of the Scala Center. This was the right moment to meet the community and discuss our involvement.

Lunatech is proud to be now an official advisory board member of the https://scala.epfl.ch/[Scala Center] since few weeks. Advisory Board consists of companies who want to support the open source community and back their strategic investment in Scala and its technologies

The Scala Center acts as an open source foundation for Scala. It is a unit within http://epfl.ch/[EPFL], a world-class research university in Lausanne, Switzerland. The Scala Center is the Scala language foundation created to help encourage sustainable development in the Scala open source space.

Like other open source foundations, its goals are to promote, support, and advance Scala. It will engage with developers in the open-source community in an effort to improve the language, its tools and its documentation. The centre will also help developers learn the language through massive open online courses, seminars and other activities.

Scala Center, and its Director and author of Scala.js, Sebastien Doraene, bring together a coalition of individuals and organisations working together to contribute to Scala. All members, individual and corporate, are actively involved in the Scala project.

Erik Bakker (our CTO) is assigned as Lunatech representative. According to Darja Jovanovic (Community Manager at the Scala Center and organiser of the last Scala Days), the Scala Center and its members aim to share the relevant information to choose what is the best way to develop the technologies and the Scala community.

Lunatech's membership at the Scala Center is reinforcing Lunatech’s position in the Scala community. We will now be part of the few companies involved at the source of the improvement of Scala. Indeed, Scala being one of our expertise for many years, this partnership means a lot to us!
