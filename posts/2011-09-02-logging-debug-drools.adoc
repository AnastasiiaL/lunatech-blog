:title: Logging debug messages with Drools
:tags: [java,drools]

This article shows a neat way to
log debug messages from rules in Drools Rule Language (DRL). This is a
recipe from the *Lunatech Drools Cookbook* - recipes for effective
http://www.jboss.org/drools[Drools] use.

== Problem

It is very frequently useful to add debug-level log statements to rules.
Each log statement needs to indicate which rule is being debugged, and
the log message generally includes parameters.

== Solution

Define a DRL ‘function’ for logging via Log4J that you can use in your
rules. This is implemented in the following Java class.

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false]
----
package com.lunatech.drools;

import org.apache.log4j.Logger;
import org.drools.spi.KnowledgeHelper;

/**
 * Functions for use in DRL files.
 */
public class RuleFunctions {

    /**
     * Log a debug message from a rule, using the rule’s package and name as the Log4J
     * category.
     */
    public static void log(final KnowledgeHelper drools, final String message,
        final Object... parameters) {

        final String category = drools.getRule().getPackageName() + "." 
            + drools.getRule().getName();
        final String formattedMessage = String.format(message, parameters);
        Logger.getLogger(category).debug(formattedMessage);
    }
----

To use this, first declare the function at the top of the DRL file in
the import section.

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false]
----
import function com.lunatech.drools.RuleFunctions.log;
----

Then you can replace a logging statement such as:

[source,brush:,plain;,gutter:,false]
----
rule "Total price"
when
   …
then
   …
   log.debug("Total price: " + items + " items, total price = " + price);
end
----

with:

[source,brush:,plain;,gutter:,false]
----
rule "Total price"
when
   …
then
   …
   log(drools, "%d items, total price = %d", items, price);
end
----

[[how]]
== How it works

The first argument is the `drools` object, which is an instance of
`org.drools.spi.KnowledgeHelper` that provides access to the working
memory that the logging function uses to get the rule context - the
rule's package name and rule name. The second argument is a log message,
which may contain placeholders for the optional varargs arguments.

The log function joins the rule's package name and rule name with a dot,
to form the Log4J category name to use instead of the more usual
fully-qualified Java class name. This makes it possible to use the Log4J
configuration to filter the debug logging by package and rule.

Secondly, the log function uses `java.lang.String.format` to format the
log message using the placeholders and arguments.

Finally, the log function uses Log4J to output the log message.
